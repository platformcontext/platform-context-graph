# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes target the latest release only.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest  | Yes       |
| Older   | No        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public GitHub issue for security problems.

Instead:

1. Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) if enabled for this repository.
2. If private reporting is unavailable, contact the maintainers privately before disclosure.
3. Include the impact, reproduction steps, affected components, and any suggested mitigation.

We aim to acknowledge reports promptly and coordinate disclosure after a fix is available.

## Disclosure Guidelines

- Do not publicly disclose an issue before a fix is released.
- Avoid testing in ways that could harm users, systems, or data.
- Report in good faith with enough detail to reproduce the issue.

## Operational Notes

When running PlatformContextGraph in production:

- Keep dependencies up to date.
- Restrict network exposure of HTTP endpoints — the API is designed for internal use.
- Avoid committing credentials or `.env` files.
- Review graph data sources and access boundaries, especially when indexing repos from multiple orgs.
