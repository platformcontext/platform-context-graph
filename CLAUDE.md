# PlatformContextGraph Development Guide For AI Agents

PlatformContextGraph (PCG) is a code-to-cloud context graph for CLI, MCP, and
HTTP API workflows. Treat it as a production data platform, not a script
collection.

The current branch is a Go-owned runtime:

- **API** serves HTTP reads and admin/query surfaces.
- **MCP Server** serves tool-facing read workflows.
- **Ingester** owns repo sync, discovery, parsing, and fact emission.
- **Reducer / Resolution Engine** owns queued projection, repair, and shared
  materialization.
- **Bootstrap Index** owns one-shot local or deployment seeding.

There is no Python runtime on the normal platform path. Python remains only in
fixture corpora used to validate parser behavior.

## Mandatory Repo Rules

- MUST use `rg` for all text/content searches. NEVER use `grep`.
- MUST use `rg --files` or globbing for file discovery. NEVER use `find`.
- MUST use the Grep tool, backed by `rg`, instead of shell `grep`.
- MUST read local repo docs before searching code or the web.
- MUST ask when intent, architecture, risk, or active ADR ownership is unclear.
- MUST apply TDD when writing or modifying code.
- MUST keep files under 500 lines; split modules before they approach the limit.
- MUST NEVER add AI attribution to commits, PRs, or docs.
- MUST NEVER push to `main` or `master`.
- MUST ALWAYS create git worktrees before executing plans or PRDs.
- MUST follow the Google Python Style Guide for any Python fixtures or tools.
- MUST follow Effective Go and the official Go style guide for all Go code.
- MUST use strict mode and proper typing for TypeScript; no `any` without an
  explicit justification.
- MUST follow HashiCorp best practices for Terraform.
- MUST follow Helm chart best practices, including helpers, `NOTES.txt`, and
  values schema.

## Priority Order

Every technical decision follows this order:

1. **Accuracy** - wrong graph truth, query truth, or deployment truth is a
   product failure.
2. **Performance** - prove the correct path can scale to repo-scale inputs.
3. **Reliability** - preserve correctness and measured performance while making
   the system recoverable and operable.

Do not optimize a behavior you have not proven correct. Do not make a system
more reliable by hiding wrong results, swallowing failures, or inventing silent
fallbacks.

## Read These First

Before changing runtime, deployment, ingestion, parsing, graph, queue, or
observability behavior, read these pages in order:

1. `docs/docs/deployment/service-runtimes.md`
2. `docs/docs/reference/local-testing.md`
3. `docs/docs/reference/telemetry/index.md`
4. `docs/docs/architecture.md`

If a change affects Docker Compose, also read:

- `docs/docs/deployment/docker-compose.md`

If a change affects NornicDB knobs or compatibility, also read:

- `docs/docs/reference/nornicdb-tuning.md`
- `docs/docs/adrs/2026-04-22-nornicdb-graph-backend-candidate.md`
- `docs/docs/adrs/2026-04-20-embedded-local-backends-implementation-plan.md`

## Skill Routing

For PCG runtime diagnostics, reducer throughput, graph backend performance,
queue behavior, remote proof runs, and ADR evidence updates, start with the
`pcg-diagnostic-rigor` skill.

Add specialized skills only when the change touches that surface:

- `golang-engineering` for Go code edits and Go tests.
- `cypher-query-rigor` for graph query/write/index or backend dialect work.
- `concurrency-deadlock-rigor` for workers, leases, conflict keys, retries, or
  queue ordering.
- `pcg-correlation-truth` for correlation, materialization truth, or query
  truth.
- `skill-creator` for creating or updating skills.

## Golden Rules

### 1. Understand The Flow Before Touching Code

Do not modify code until you can explain the relevant path end to end:

```text
sync -> discover -> parse -> emit facts -> enqueue work -> reducer -> graph/content projection -> query surface
```

For non-trivial changes, map:

- where data enters
- how it is transformed
- where it is persisted
- who consumes it
- transaction boundaries
- async boundaries and retries
- ownership boundaries
- invariants assumed by each step

If the flow is unclear, research first. If intent or active architecture is
still unclear after local research, ask.

### 2. Prove Value Before Calling Work Ready

Every change needs evidence appropriate to its risk:

- bug fixes need a failing regression test first
- performance work needs before/after benchmarks or runtime measurements
- queue/concurrency work needs contention, retry, idempotency, and ordering
  proof
- graph truth work needs fixture intent, graph truth, and API/query truth
  agreement
- runtime changes need telemetry and operator diagnosis paths
- doc-only changes need the docs build gate when they affect docs navigation or
  project guidance

Do not say work is ready without listing the commands or runtime proof actually
run.

### 3. Root Cause Beats Patches

Do not paper over symptoms with shallow workarounds, silent fallbacks, or
speculative "good enough" fixes.

Required debugging shape:

1. Gather evidence.
2. Form hypotheses.
3. Prove or disprove each likely cause.
4. Fix the actual failure mode.
5. Add regression coverage and telemetry when runtime behavior changed.

Small diffs are welcome only when they fix the right design.

### 4. Edge Cases Are Mandatory

Before implementing any bug fix or design change, account for:

- invalid input
- empty state
- stale state
- partial failure
- duplicate delivery
- retries
- ordering issues
- idempotency
- concurrency
- rollback behavior

For correlation or materialization changes, include one positive case, one
negative case, and one ambiguous case before claiming the design is understood.

### 5. Preserve Service Boundaries

Do not collapse ownership boundaries casually.

| Area | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `go/internal/collector/` | Git collection, discovery, snapshotting, parsing inputs |
| `go/internal/parser/` | parser registry, adapters, language behavior, SCIP support |
| `go/internal/facts/` | durable fact models and queue contracts |
| `go/internal/storage/postgres/` | facts, queue, status, content, recovery, decisions |
| `go/internal/storage/cypher/` | backend-neutral Cypher write contracts, canonical graph writers, edge helpers, and write instrumentation |
| `go/internal/storage/neo4j/` | Neo4j-specific graph adapters |
| `go/internal/projector/` | source-local projection stages |
| `go/internal/reducer/` | cross-domain materialization and shared projection |
| `go/internal/relationships/` | Terraform, Helm, Kustomize, Argo extraction |
| `go/internal/query/` | HTTP handlers, OpenAPI, query/read surfaces |
| `go/internal/runtime/` | admin, status, probes, retry policy, lifecycle |
| `go/internal/status/` | pipeline and request lifecycle reporting |
| `go/internal/telemetry/` | OTEL tracing, metrics, structured logs |
| `go/internal/truth/` | canonical truth contracts |

Handlers depend on ports such as `GraphQuery` and `GraphWrite`, not concrete
backend implementations. Backend dialect differences belong only in documented
narrow seams.

### 6. Observability Is Part Of The Feature

Every runtime-affecting code change must include telemetry operators can use at
3 AM.

Ask:

- Is it stuck?
- Is it slow?
- Is it failing?
- Is it using too much memory?
- Did it finish?

If metrics, traces, logs, and status surfaces cannot answer those questions,
the design is incomplete.

### 7. Compatibility Without Hidden Branches

PCG supports `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND={neo4j,nornicdb}` behind graph ports.

- `nornicdb` is the officially supported default backend used in Compose and
  production.
- `neo4j` is an alternative backend only when it can run PCG's shared
  Cypher/Bolt contract without a separate writer stream.

Invalid backend values must fail at startup. Backend selection must surface in
telemetry as `graph_backend` and optionally in response truth metadata as
`truth.backend`.

Do not add backend branches outside documented narrow seams such as schema DDL,
connection/runtime settings, retry classification, and query builders. A new
Cypher/Bolt backend must support the raw PCG Cypher calls or require only minor,
evidence-backed adapter differences.

## Runtime Contract

| Runtime | Responsibility | Command | Kubernetes shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API | HTTP API, admin/query reads | `pcg api start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080` | `Deployment` |
| MCP Server | MCP tool server | `pcg mcp start` | `Deployment` or sidecar |
| Ingester | Repo sync, parse, fact emission | `/usr/local/bin/pcg-ingester` | `StatefulSet` + PVC |
| Reducer | Queue drain, graph projection, repair flows | `/usr/local/bin/pcg-reducer` | `Deployment` |
| Bootstrap Index | One-shot initial indexing | `/usr/local/bin/pcg-bootstrap-index` | job / init step |

Shared backing stores:

- **NornicDB** for the canonical graph by default; Neo4j only for explicit
  compatibility deployments that meet the shared Cypher contract
- **Postgres** for facts, queue state, content store, status, and recovery data

## Local Development

Full stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Runtime Repro Hygiene

Before any dogfood, local-authoritative, Compose, or runtime validation that
executes local PCG binaries, rebuild them first:

```bash
cd go
go build -o ./bin/pcg ./cmd/pcg
go build -o ./bin/pcg-api ./cmd/api
go build -o ./bin/pcg-ingester ./cmd/ingester
go build -o ./bin/pcg-reducer ./cmd/reducer
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
```

`pcg graph start` discovers `pcg-reducer` and `pcg-ingester` through `PATH`, so
fresh owner runs need `go/bin` on `PATH`.

When building or testing NornicDB binaries from the local reference repos, use
the no-local-LLM tags first:

```bash
go test -tags 'noui nolocalllm' ./...
go build -tags 'noui nolocalllm' ...
```

### NornicDB Maintainer Patch Bar

PCG maintainers are allowed to patch NornicDB, but only when the change is
evidence-backed:

- a correctness fix for NornicDB itself,
- a measured NornicDB performance win that generalizes beyond one PCG symptom,
  or
- a measured PCG runtime win proven by focused and corpus-level evidence.

Do not keep NornicDB patches for speculative PCG throughput hypotheses. If a
patch does not produce a real backend or PCG win, revert it and continue testing
against upstream `main` or the latest owner-merged build.

## TDD And Bug Fix Workflow

For bugs, use this mandatory sequence:

1. Write a failing test that reproduces the exact bug condition.
2. Run the focused test and verify it fails for the expected reason.
3. Implement the smallest correct fix at the right ownership boundary.
4. Re-run the focused test and verify it passes.
5. Add regression variations for edge cases, retries, ordering, or concurrency
   when relevant.
6. Run the smallest package or integration gate that proves the touched
   contract.

For new features, write the contract or behavioral test first unless the work
is pure documentation.

## Performance Workflow

Performance work must show measurable value:

1. Capture a baseline with a benchmark, trace, metric sample, runtime status
   report, or focused compose proof.
2. Identify whether the bottleneck is algorithmic, allocation-heavy,
   concurrency-related, graph I/O, Postgres I/O, parser behavior, or input
   shape.
3. Change the narrowest layer that owns the bottleneck.
4. Capture after-data with the same measurement.
5. Document material trade-offs, including memory, queue depth, and failure
   behavior.

Do not lower graph-write timeouts, global batch sizes, or worker counts because
one repository is noisy. First use `pcg index --discovery-report` and consider a
repo-local `.pcg/discovery.json` or process-local discovery overlay.

## Concurrency Workflow

Before changing workers, leases, retries, queues, transactions, or shared graph
writes, describe:

- shared state
- lock or claim ordering
- transaction scope and duration
- retry boundaries
- idempotency keys
- conflict domains
- starvation and contention risks
- write amplification
- dead-letter behavior

Research the actual locking and consistency behavior of Postgres, Neo4j,
NornicDB, or the Go runtime path in use. Never rely on intuition alone.

## Facts-First Bootstrap Ordering

The bootstrap-index orchestrator in `go/cmd/bootstrap-index/main.go` runs a
multi-pass pipeline. Editing reducer or projector domains without understanding
this ordering creates E2E-only bugs.

```text
Phase 1 - Collection + First-Pass Reduction
  bootstrap-index collects repos and emits facts.
  resolution-engine drains first-pass domains.
  deployment_mapping can remain pending because resolved_relationships do not
  exist yet.

Phase 2 - Backfill
  BackfillAllRelationshipEvidence() populates relationship_evidence_facts and
  publishes readiness rows.

Phase 3 - Deployment Mapping Reopen
  ReopenDeploymentMappingWorkItems() reopens deployment_mapping so the reducer
  can create resolved_relationships.

Phase 4 - Second-Pass Consumers
  Any domain that consumes resolved_relationships must have a re-trigger
  mechanism after Phase 3.
```

Key rule: any domain that consumes `resolved_relationships` must have a
post-Phase-3 reopen or re-trigger mechanism.

## Correlation Truth Gates

Use `pcg-correlation-truth` whenever a change touches workload admission,
deployable-unit correlation, materialization, deployment tracing, or query truth
in `go/internal/reducer`, `go/internal/query`, `go/internal/graph`,
`go/internal/relationships`, or correlation fixtures.

Required proof:

- explain raw evidence -> candidate -> admission -> projection row -> graph
  write -> query surface
- include positive, negative, and ambiguous cases
- prove what materializes and what remains provenance-only
- validate utility repos, controller repos, deployment repos, and ambiguous
  multi-unit repos
- run a fresh rebuild/restart path before blaming timing
- compare fixture intent, reducer graph truth, and API/query truth

Namespace, folder, or repo-name heuristics must not invent environment or
platform truth unless backed by explicit environment aliases or stronger
deployment evidence.

## Observability Contract

Every runtime-affecting code change must include telemetry.

| Change type | Required telemetry |
| --- | --- |
| New pipeline stage or worker | OTEL span, duration histogram, success/failure counter |
| New Postgres or Neo4j query | Duration histogram via `InstrumentedDB`, error counter |
| New queue consumer | Claim duration histogram, processing duration histogram, depth gauge |
| New retry/skip path | Counter with reason label, structured log with `failure_class` |
| Memory or resource tuning | Observable gauge reporting configured limit |
| Batch processing | Batch size histogram, batches committed counter |

Implementation rules:

- Metrics live in `go/internal/telemetry/instruments.go`.
- Metric names use the `pcg_dp_` prefix.
- New metric dimensions go in `go/internal/telemetry/contract.go`.
- Spans use `tracer.Start(ctx, telemetry.SpanXxx)`.
- New span names go in `contract.go`.
- Structured logs use `slog` with `telemetry.ScopeAttrs()`,
  `telemetry.PhaseAttr()`, and `telemetry.FailureClassAttr()`.
- Log keys are frozen in `contract.go`; reuse existing keys before adding new
  ones.
- High-cardinality values such as file paths and fact IDs belong in spans or
  logs, not metric labels.

## NornicDB Compatibility Workflow

When PCG hits a NornicDB incompatibility such as Cypher parse rejection,
rollback behavior, driver shape mismatch, or a missing procedure:

1. Check upstream source before guessing:
   - `/Users/allen/os-repos/NornicDB/`
   - `/Users/allen/os-repos/NornicDB-pcg-bolt-rollback/`
2. Decide from evidence:
   - if NornicDB supports it, fix PCG
   - if NornicDB has a workaround, use a documented backend-dialect seam
   - if NornicDB must be patched, land the fix in the PCG-maintained fork,
     rebuild, and pin the binary until upstream absorbs it
3. Record the decision in the NornicDB ADR adapter evidence row and the active
   embedded-local-backends chunk status row.

When adding or changing any `PCG_NORNICDB_*` tuning knob, update the tuning
reference, active ADR, and local testing runbook in the same PR.

## Documentation Discipline

Every code PR that touches user-visible wire contracts, CLI flags, environment
variables, runtime profiles, capability ports, collector plugin contracts, or
chunk boundaries must include:

1. Update the active ADR `## Chunk Status` table or equivalent tracker. If you
   are unsure which ADR is active, ask.
2. Update affected user-facing docs:
   - `docs/docs/reference/http-api.md`
   - `docs/docs/reference/cli-reference.md`
   - `docs/docs/guides/mcp-guide.md`
   - `docs/docs/why-pcg.md`
   - `docs/docs/architecture.md`
   - `docs/docs/getting-started/*`
3. Add `doc.go` for any new Go package, with a package-level comment naming
   the spec it implements.
4. Document every new or touched exported Go type, interface, function, method,
   constant group, and variable with a useful Go doc comment. The comment must
   explain the contract, invariant, failure mode, or operational reason for the
   API; placeholder comments that only repeat the identifier are not acceptable.
5. Add comments for new or touched unexported Go helpers when they encode a
   contract, storage/query assumption, concurrency rule, retry rule, or
   regression purpose.
6. Every Go package directory in `go/` has three files: `doc.go`,
   `README.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. `doc.go` carries the package contract for
   `go doc` consumers (real exported identifiers, invariants, failure
   modes). `README.md` carries the architectural and operational lens for
   human contributors — pipeline-position mermaid, internal-flow mermaid,
   lifecycle prose, exported surface, dependencies, telemetry the package
   emits, operational runbook notes, extension points, and gotchas with
   `file.go:line` cites. `AGENTS.md` carries guidance for LLM assistants
   editing the package — read-first ordered file list, invariants citing
   file:line, common changes scoped by file, failure modes mapped to
   metric/log/span, package-specific anti-patterns, and what NOT to change
   without an ADR. Three audiences, three files, no duplication. The
   `pcg-folder-doc-keeper` skill (in `.agents/skills/`, symlinked into
   `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/`) defines the writing standards.
   The PostToolUse hooks at `.claude/hooks/pcg-doc-staleness.sh` (Claude
   Code) and `.codex/hooks/pcg-doc-staleness.sh` (Codex) flag drift in
   `.pcg-doc-state/stale.jsonl`. The slop gate at
   `scripts/verify-doc-claims.sh` confirms every backticked Go identifier
   in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` appears literally in source, every
   `file.go:NN` cite resolves to a real line, and no marketing words
   leaked through. Run the verifier on a package before committing
   doc-only changes there. Container directories without Go source
   (`go/`, `go/cmd/`, `go/internal/`, `go/internal/storage/`,
   `go/internal/terraformschema/schemas/`) keep `README.md` only — they
   are not Go packages. Docs directories may use `index.md`; generated,
   vendor, build, cache, and fixture leaf directories are exempt.
7. Keep OpenAPI changes in lockstep with `go/internal/query/openapi*.go`,
   handler tests, and `docs/docs/reference/http-api.md`. Do not document
   Swagger UI or ReDoc routes unless the server actually registers them.
8. Document new extensibility seams in `docs/docs/architecture.md`,
   `docs/docs/why-pcg.md`, and a dedicated reference page.

`AGENTS.md` mirrors `CLAUDE.md`. Any edit to one must be mirrored in the other
in the same PR.

## Verification Defaults

Use `docs/docs/reference/local-testing.md` as the source of truth.

Common gates:

```bash
cd go && go test ./cmd/pcg ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query ./internal/mcp -count=1
cd go && go test ./internal/parser ./internal/collector/discovery ./internal/content/shape ./internal/collector -count=1
cd go && go test ./internal/terraformschema ./internal/relationships -count=1
cd go && go test ./cmd/bootstrap-index ./cmd/ingester ./cmd/reducer ./internal/runtime ./internal/status ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1
cd go && golangci-lint run ./...
uv run --with mkdocs --with mkdocs-material --with pymdown-extensions \
  mkdocs build --strict --clean --config-file docs/mkdocs.yml
git diff --check
```

Docs, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or README changes require the docs build plus
`git diff --check`:

```bash
uv run --with mkdocs --with mkdocs-material --with pymdown-extensions \
  mkdocs build --strict --clean --config-file docs/mkdocs.yml
```

## Doc-keeper Workflow

Every Go package directory in `go/` carries three files: `doc.go`,
`README.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. The `pcg-folder-doc-keeper` skill (in
`.agents/skills/`, symlinked into `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/`)
defines the writing standards. A PostToolUse hook for Claude Code
(`.claude/hooks/pcg-doc-staleness.sh`, matcher `Edit|MultiEdit|Write`)
and one for Codex (`.codex/hooks/pcg-doc-staleness.sh`, matcher
`^apply_patch$`) both delegate to a tool-neutral
`scripts/check-docs-stale.sh`, which writes a JSONL drift snapshot to
`.pcg-doc-state/stale.jsonl` (gitignored). A separate slop gate at
`scripts/verify-doc-claims.sh` validates that documentation claims are
grounded in source.

Workflow:

1. After editing files under `go/`, run the drift check if you are using a
   tool that does not have hooks installed:

   ```bash
   scripts/check-docs-stale.sh --all
   ```

   The script is `stat`-based and fast. `--all` rebuilds the snapshot from
   scratch every run.

2. If `.pcg-doc-state/stale.jsonl` is non-empty, invoke the
   `pcg-folder-doc-keeper` skill before committing. The skill reads the
   snapshot, scopes its update to the directories it names, and refreshes
   only the affected sections of `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `doc.go`.

3. Before committing doc-only changes to a package, run the slop gate on
   that package:

   ```bash
   scripts/verify-doc-claims.sh go/internal/<pkg>
   ```

   The verifier (a) confirms every backticked Go identifier in `README.md`
   and `AGENTS.md` appears literally in the package's `.go` files (or is
   in the explicit allowlist of stdlib / project-wide names), (b) checks
   every `file.go:NN` cite — file exists in the package, line is within
   EOF, and at least one identifier from the same paragraph appears within
   ±10 lines of the cited line — to catch citation drift, (c) runs an
   anti-marketing pass that fails on `leverages, seamlessly, robust,
   powerful, comprehensive, key role, stands as, serves as, underscores,
   showcases, facilitates, delves`. Run with `--all` to walk every Go
   package under `go/`.

4. The drift check hook is a snapshot, not a log: it overwrites
   `stale.jsonl` on each `--all` run, so you do not need to clear it
   manually. If you want to keep history, rotate the file to a `.resolved`
   sibling before the next tool use.

5. Both scripts are suitable as git `pre-commit` hooks; install them
   locally with the CI/CD pre-commit framework or a thin wrapper.

Container directories without Go source (`go/`, `go/cmd/`, `go/internal/`,
`go/internal/storage/`, `go/internal/terraformschema/schemas/`) keep
`README.md` only — they are not Go packages, so `doc.go` would not compile
and the LLM-assistant `AGENTS.md` is not useful where there is no code to
edit.

## Git Auth Switching

Switch GitHub auth before any `git push` or `gh pr create`:

| Repo path | Auth user | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/personal-repos/*` | `linuxdynasty` | `gh auth switch --user linuxdynasty` |
| `~/repos/*` | configured work account | `gh auth switch --user <work-account>` |

When working across both paths in one workflow, switch at each repo boundary.

## Remote Build Hygiene

When rebuilding Go projects over non-interactive SSH:

- do not assume the remote shell loads the same `PATH`
- check `command -v go` and common absolute paths such as `/usr/local/go/bin/go`
- if Go exists only at an absolute path, use that path for remote `go build`
  and `go test`
- keep hostnames, IPs, private key paths, and machine-specific repo paths out of
  open-source docs

## Pre-Ready Checklist

Before saying work is complete:

- repo docs read for the touched surface
- relevant skill used
- data/control flow understood end to end
- tests written first for code changes
- edge cases considered
- telemetry added for runtime behavior
- docs and active ADRs updated for contract changes
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` kept in lockstep if either changed
- `golangci-lint run ./...` clean for Go changes
- focused verification run and cited
- `git diff --check` clean
