# Codex PostToolUse hook (matcher: ^apply_patch$).
# Reads Codex's tool payload from stdin. Codex's apply_patch shape varies by
# version, and the patch body lists multiple files at once. Rather than parse
# the patch, we run scripts/check-docs-stale.sh --all to produce a fresh
# snapshot of drift across go/. The script is fast (stat-based) and the
# --all mode truncates state so duplicate appends don't accumulate.
