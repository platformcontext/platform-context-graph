## Worked example 1 — go/internal/runtime

`runtime` is a shared-process utility package. The README focuses on which
binaries depend on it; the doc.go states the runtime contract.

`README.md`:

```markdown
# Runtime

## Purpose

The runtime package owns shared process wiring: admin muxes, health and
status handlers, datastore configuration, retry policy, memory limits, API
key resolution, and Compose/runtime contract tests.

## Ownership boundary

Process-level wiring used by every PCG binary. Does not own domain logic
(facts, queue, projection) — those have their own packages.

## Exported surface

- `Config`, `LoadConfig` — service-level config loaded from the environment
- `LoadGraphBackend`, `LoadPostgresConfig`, `LoadNeo4jConfig` — datastore
  configuration loaders backing every PCG binary
- `OpenPostgres`, `OpenNeo4jDriver` — datastore openers used at startup
- `NewStatusAdminServer`, `HTTPServer` — shared `/healthz`, `/readyz`,
  `/metrics`, `/admin/status` admin surface

See `doc.go` for the full contract.

## Dependencies

- `internal/telemetry` — span and metric helpers
- `internal/status` — health/readiness probes

## Telemetry

- Metrics: pcg_dp_* counters and histograms emitted by the admin handlers
  (see `internal/telemetry/instruments.go` for the canonical names)
- Spans: started via `tracer.Start(ctx, telemetry.Span*)` from
  `internal/telemetry/contract.go`
- Logs: scope and phase attributes from `telemetry.ScopeAttrs()` /
  `telemetry.PhaseAttr`

## Gotchas / invariants

- Changes here usually affect more than one binary. Update local testing
  docs, Compose docs, Helm docs, or runtime admin docs when the process
  contract changes.
- Admin endpoints must remain non-authenticated only on the admin port.

## Related docs

- `docs/docs/deployment/service-runtimes.md`
- `docs/docs/reference/local-testing.md`
```

`doc.go`:

```go
// Package runtime provides shared process runtime contracts for PCG services.
//
// The package owns admin HTTP surfaces, metrics endpoints, lifecycle wiring,
// retry policy defaults, API key checks, and data-store configuration shared by
// the API, MCP, ingester, reducer, and helper binaries.
package runtime
```

## Worked example 2 — go/internal/storage/cypher

`storage/cypher` is a backend-neutral seam. The README documents the seam
intent; doc.go states what callers can rely on.

`README.md`:

```markdown
# Cypher Storage

## Purpose

`storage/cypher` owns backend-neutral graph write contracts, canonical
writers, edge helpers, statement metadata, and write instrumentation.

## Ownership boundary

Backend-neutral. Dialect-specific behavior belongs in
`storage/neo4j` or the NornicDB adapter, not here.

## Exported surface

- `Statement`, `Plan` — typed Cypher write with metadata
- `Executor` — seam every backend implements; wrapped by
  `InstrumentedExecutor`, `RetryingExecutor`, `TimeoutExecutor`,
  `ExecuteOnlyExecutor`
- `CanonicalNodeWriter`, `EdgeWriter` — canonical node and edge writers
- `BuildCanonical*` and `BuildRetract*` statement builders for the canonical
  graph upserts and retractions

See `doc.go` for the contract.

## Dependencies

- `internal/telemetry` — write instrumentation
- consumers in `internal/projector`, `internal/reducer`

## Telemetry

- Metrics: pcg_dp_canonical_* counters and histograms exposed via
  `telemetry.Instruments` (`internal/telemetry/instruments.go`)
- Spans: write phase and domain attributes via `telemetry.AttrWritePhase`,
  `telemetry.AttrDomain`

## Gotchas / invariants

- Do not spread `neo4j` or `nornicdb` conditionals through caller packages.
  When backends differ, add the seam here as a schema adapter, writer
  option, or query builder.
- Canonical writers must remain idempotent; reducers retry on conflict.

## Related docs

- `docs/docs/architecture.md` (graph backend section)
- `docs/docs/adrs/2026-04-22-nornicdb-graph-backend-candidate.md`
```

`doc.go`:

```go
// Package cypher defines the backend-neutral Cypher write contract for PCG.
//
// The package exposes the Executor seam, Statement/Plan metadata, canonical
// node and edge writers (CanonicalNodeWriter, EdgeWriter), and the
// BuildCanonical* / BuildRetract* statement builders. Backend dialects
// (Neo4j, NornicDB) implement Executor behind documented narrow seams;
// callers depend on this package, not on a concrete backend.
package cypher
```

## Worked example 3 — a leaf package (correlation/explain)

Smaller packages still get both files. Keep sections short rather than
omitting them.

`README.md`:

```markdown
# Correlation Explain

## Purpose

Renders correlation decisions into human-readable explanations consumed by
the explain API and the MCP server.

## Ownership boundary

Read-only formatter. Does not run correlation rules — that lives in
`correlation/engine`.

## Exported surface

- `Render(decision Decision) Explanation` — produce a structured
  explanation from an admission decision

See `doc.go` for the contract.

## Dependencies

- `internal/correlation/model` — decision shape
- `internal/truth` — canonical truth references

## Telemetry

None. Explanations are produced inline with the calling request and
inherit its span.

## Gotchas / invariants

- Explanations must reference the same evidence the engine considered, in
  the same order. Out-of-order rendering misleads operators.

## Related docs

- `docs/docs/reference/http-api.md` (explain endpoint)
```

`doc.go`:

```go
// Package explain renders correlation admission decisions into structured
// explanations for the explain API and MCP consumers.
//
// Each explanation lists the evidence the engine considered in the order it
// was applied, so operators can replay the decision against fixtures.
package explain
```

## Anti-patterns to reject

- README that is just an alphabetized list of file names. Files change; the
  list rots. Describe the surface, not the directory listing.
- doc.go whose comment is "// Package x." with nothing else.
- README and doc.go that both contain the same paragraph. Link, don't
  duplicate.
- README that lists every exported identifier with one-line repeats of the
  godoc comment. The README is for context that godoc cannot carry.
- "Robust," "powerful," "comprehensive," "robust solution." Cut every one.
