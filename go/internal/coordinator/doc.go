// Package coordinator runs the workflow coordinator's reconcile, expired-claim
// reap, and workflow-run reconciliation loops.
//
// Service ticks reconcile declarative collector instances against the durable
// store on every reconcile interval. In active mode it also drains expired
// claims on the reap interval and advances workflow run progress. Config is
// loaded from PCG_WORKFLOW_COORDINATOR_* environment variables; deployment
// mode is "dark" or "active" and active mode requires claims enabled with at
// least one claim-capable collector instance.
