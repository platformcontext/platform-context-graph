# AGENTS.md — internal/parser guidance for LLM assistants

## Read first

1. `go/internal/parser/README.md` — pipeline position, registered languages,
   SCIP path, exported surface, and invariants
2. `go/internal/parser/registry.go` — `Registry`, `Definition`,
   `NewRegistry`, `DefaultRegistry`, `defaultDefinitions`, `LookupByPath`
3. `go/internal/parser/engine.go` — `Engine`, `DefaultEngine`, `ParsePath`,
   `PreScanRepositoryPathsWithWorkers`, and the `parseDefinition` dispatch
4. `go/internal/parser/runtime.go` — `Runtime`; tree-sitter grammar caching
5. `go/internal/parser/scip_support.go` — `SCIPIndexer`,
   `DetectSCIPProjectLanguage`, SCIP binary map
6. `go/internal/parser/doc.go` — the package contract, especially the
   determinism invariant
7. `go/internal/telemetry/instruments.go` — `telemetry.FileParseDuration` before
   adding parse-time metrics

## Invariants this package enforces

- **Determinism** — `doc.go` states parsers must be deterministic given the
  same source bytes. Retry and repair runs must converge on the same output.
  Do not introduce non-deterministic behavior (random map iteration, timestamps,
  process-local state) into any language adapter.

- **Fact truth preservation** — when a language adapter starts emitting a new
  entity key, relationship key, or metadata field, the corresponding `internal/facts`
  contracts, test fixtures, and `internal/content/shape` must be updated in the
  same branch. Emitting keys that `shape.Materialize` does not consume silently
  discards data.

- **Registry immutability** — `Registry` is built once via `NewRegistry` and
  never mutated. `LookupByPath`, `LookupByExtension`, and `LookupByParserKey`
  return cloned `Definition` values. Do not add mutable state to `Registry`.

- **No duplicate keys or extensions** — `NewRegistry` rejects duplicate
  `ParserKey`, extension, and exact filename entries with an error.
  `DefaultRegistry` panics on construction failure because a duplicate in
  `defaultDefinitions` is a programming error that must surface immediately.

- **Shared Runtime** — `NewRuntime()` should be called once and shared across
  all `Engine` instances and all parse calls. `Runtime.Language(name)` is
  mutex-protected for concurrent use. Do not allocate a new `Runtime` per file
  or per goroutine.

- **Absolute paths in Engine.ParsePath** — `ParsePath` calls `filepath.Abs`
  on both `repoRoot` and `path`. Callers may pass relative paths but the
  payload's `repo_path` field will contain the absolute form.

## Common changes and how to scope them

- **Add a new language adapter** →
  1. Add a `Definition` entry to `defaultDefinitions()` in `registry.go` with a
     unique `ParserKey`, `Language`, `Extensions` and/or `ExactNames`.
  2. Create `<language>_language.go` with a `parse<Language>` function matching
     the signature used by `parseDefinition`.
  3. Add the case to `parseDefinition` in `engine.go`.
  4. Add the pre-scan case to `preScanOnePath` if the language has import
     resolution needs.
  5. Add fixtures in the parser fixture corpus and run
     `go test ./internal/parser -count=1`.
  6. Update `internal/content/shape` if the new language emits entity keys that
     `shape.Materialize` must handle.
  7. Document the new language in the `README.md` language table.

- **Add a new entity key to an existing adapter** →
  1. Add the key to the adapter's output `map[string]any`.
  2. Add the key to the `snapshotEntityBuckets` table in
     `go/internal/collector/git_snapshot_native.go` if it is an entity type that
     the collector materializes into a content entity snapshot.
  3. Update `shape.Materialize` in `internal/content/shape`.
  4. Add a fixture test that asserts the new key appears in output for a known
     input.
  5. Update `entityTypeLabelMap` in `internal/projector/canonical.go` if the new
     entity type needs a graph node label.

- **Add SCIP support for a new language** →
  1. Add the extension-to-`scipLanguageConfig` entry in `scip_support.go`.
  2. Add the language to `scipLanguagePriority` at the appropriate priority
     position.
  3. Verify the external binary name matches what `SCIPIndexer.LookPath` would
     find.
  4. Add a test in `scip_parser_test.go` with a known SCIP index fixture.

- **Change pre-scan behavior for a language** →
  1. Edit the `preScan<Language>` function.
  2. Add a test case in `engine_<language>_*_test.go` or a new test file.
  3. Verify output is still deterministic — sort results before returning.

## Failure modes and how to debug

- Symptom: `pcg_dp_file_parse_duration_seconds` elevated for a language →
  likely cause: expensive tree-sitter query or large file → check per-language
  parse complexity in `engine_<language>_semantics_test.go` benchmarks; consider
  adding a file-size guard in the adapter.

- Symptom: entity counts drop for a language after a registry change →
  likely cause: new `Definition` duplicate rejected by `NewRegistry`, so
  `DefaultRegistry()` panics at startup → check process startup logs for
  `default parser registry is invalid`; verify the new `ParserKey` and
  extensions are unique.

- Symptom: `no parser registered` error for a file extension →
  likely cause: the extension is not in `defaultDefinitions()` or the
  file was excluded earlier in the discovery pass →
  add the extension to the correct `Definition.Extensions` list.

- Symptom: SCIP path produces no `SCIPParseResult` →
  likely cause: `scip-*` binary not on PATH, or `DetectSCIPProjectLanguage`
  returned `""` because no allowed language files exist → check the
  SCIP_LANGUAGES env var; verify binary availability with `which scip-go`
  (or equivalent).

- Symptom: import map is non-deterministic across runs →
  likely cause: `preScanOnePath` returns unordered names, or a language adapter
  iterates a map without sorting → sort names before returning from every
  `preScan<Language>` function; verify `sortPreScanResults` is called.

## Anti-patterns specific to this package

- **Calling `NewRuntime()` per file or per goroutine** — tree-sitter grammar
  loading is expensive. One shared `Runtime` is the correct model.

- **Importing internal/collector, internal/projector, or internal/storage** —
  the parser package is a leaf that `internal/collector` and `internal/query`
  depend on. Reverse or lateral imports create cycles or break the ownership
  boundary.

- **Emitting new entity keys without updating shape.Materialize** — keys not
  consumed by `shape.Materialize` are silently discarded. The fixture tests will
  not catch this unless a test asserts on the content entity output.

- **Non-deterministic map iteration in a language adapter** — Go map iteration
  order is randomized. Always collect map entries into a slice, sort, then
  process. Any randomness in parse output breaks fact idempotency.

- **Returning partial output on a parse error instead of an error value** — if
  a language adapter encounters a parse error, it should return an error, not a
  partial `map[string]any`. Partial output produces incomplete facts that are
  hard to distinguish from correct empty-entity files.

## What NOT to change without an ADR

- `defaultDefinitions()` extension assignments once a language has production
  fixture coverage — reassigning an extension (e.g. moving `.ts` from
  `typescript` to a new key) changes which parser runs on existing indexed
  files and breaks fact idempotency for those repos.
- SCIP language priority in `scipLanguagePriority` — the priority order
  determines which language wins in mixed-language repos; changing it alters
  SCIP-path fact output for all repos with multiple SCIP-capable languages.
- `Registry` mutability contract — the registry is used concurrently by the
  pre-scan worker pool; any mutable state addition requires proof of
  thread-safety and a test.
