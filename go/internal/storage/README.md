# Storage

`storage` contains the concrete persistence adapters for PCG. This directory
is a navigation root, not a Go package — each child has its own rich
`README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

Postgres stores facts, queue state, content, status, and recovery data.
The Cypher subpackage defines backend-neutral graph write contracts behind
the `Executor` seam. Neo4j and NornicDB compatibility must stay behind that
seam and documented dialect adapters.

| Subdirectory | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `cypher/` | Backend-neutral Cypher write contracts, `Executor` seam, canonical writers, statement builders, instrumentation |
| `postgres/` | Facts, queue, status, content, recovery, decisions — all Postgres-backed durable state |
| `neo4j/` | Neo4j-specific driver adapter (currently a thin stub; the active driver path lives in caller-side wiring) |

## Per-package documentation convention

Every Go package directory under `go/internal/storage/` carries three files:
`doc.go`, `README.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Open the child READMEs for full
flow diagrams and operational notes.

## Dependencies

This directory has no Go source of its own. Per-adapter dependencies are
documented in `storage/cypher/README.md`, `storage/postgres/README.md`,
and `storage/neo4j/README.md`.

## Telemetry

Adapter-specific telemetry is documented in each subpackage README. The
shared contract lives in `internal/telemetry`.
