# AGENTS.md — storage/cypher guidance for LLM assistants

## Read first

1. `go/internal/storage/cypher/README.md` — pipeline position, executor chain,
   exported surface, and operational notes
2. `go/internal/storage/cypher/writer.go` — `Executor` interface, `Statement`,
   `Plan`, `GroupExecutor`, `PhaseGroupExecutor`, `Adapter`; the full contract
   before touching anything else
3. `go/internal/storage/cypher/canonical_node_writer.go` — `CanonicalNodeWriter.Write`,
   phase dispatch, and the GroupExecutor/PhaseGroupExecutor/sequential paths
4. `go/internal/storage/cypher/retrying_executor.go` — NornicDB MERGE unique
   conflict handling and why `ExecuteGroup` does not retry
5. `go/internal/telemetry/instruments.go` and `contract.go` — metric names and
   span constants before adding new telemetry

## Invariants this package enforces

- **Idempotency** — every write path uses MERGE or ON CONFLICT semantics; no
  unconditional CREATE. `doc.go` states this as a package invariant.
- **Phase order** — `CanonicalNodeWriter.Write` phases run strictly in order:
  retract → repository → directories → files → entities → entity_containment →
  modules → structural_edges. Parent nodes must exist before child MATCH
  statements run (`canonical_node_writer.go:218`).
- **No GraphWrite type** — this package does not export a GraphWrite port.
  The backend seam is `Executor`. Every caller in `internal/projector` and
  `internal/reducer` uses the projector CanonicalWriter or
  SharedProjectionEdgeWriter interfaces that are backed by `CanonicalNodeWriter`
  and `EdgeWriter`.
- **No direct driver calls in this package** — the concrete Neo4j and NornicDB
  driver sessions live in `cmd/` wiring. This package only defines contracts.
- **RetryingExecutor.ExecuteGroup skips the retry loop** — the driver's own
  `GroupExecutor` implementation already retries transient errors for the group
  path; adding a retry loop in `RetryingExecutor` would double-retry
  (`retrying_executor.go:87`).
- **OperationCanonicalUpsert vs. OperationUpsertNode** — canonical domain nodes
  use `OperationCanonicalUpsert`; source-local `SourceLocalRecord` writes use
  `OperationUpsertNode`/`OperationDeleteNode`. Do not mix them.

## Common changes and how to scope them

- **Add a new canonical domain node type** → add a BuildCanonical...Upsert
  function (follow the pattern of `BuildCanonicalWorkloadUpsert`) in
  `canonical.go` or a new file; add a BuildRetract... companion following
  `BuildRetractRepoDependencyEdges` in `canonical_retract.go`; add unit tests in
  `canonical_test.go`. No writer changes needed — callers build the `Statement`
  and pass it to any `Executor`.

- **Add a new shared projection domain (EdgeWriter)** → add the domain constant
  in `internal/reducer`; add a `batchCypherForDomain` case and a `buildRowMap`
  case in `edge_writer.go`; add tests in `edge_writer_test.go`. Verify the new
  UNWIND Cypher template against both Neo4j and NornicDB if both backends are
  active.

- **Add a new executor wrapper** → implement `Executor`; optionally implement
  `GroupExecutor` and/or `PhaseGroupExecutor`; add unit tests. Wire in `cmd/`
  only, not here.

- **Tune batch sizes for a backend** → use `CanonicalNodeWriter` builder
  options (`WithEntityBatchSize`, `WithEntityLabelBatchSize`, etc.) in `cmd/`
  wiring. Do not hard-code backend-specific values inside `canonical_node_writer.go`.

- **Add telemetry for a new metric** → add the instrument to
  `go/internal/telemetry/instruments.go`; add the metric name string to the
  compile-time list in `go/internal/telemetry/contract.go`; record via
  `Instruments.*` in the write path.

## Failure modes and how to debug

- Symptom: `pcg_dp_neo4j_deadlock_retries_total` rising → likely cause:
  concurrent MERGE on shared nodes (Repository, Directory) → check worker
  concurrency in projector/reducer; `RetryingExecutor.MaxRetries` is 3 by
  default; raising it extends recovery time.

- Symptom: `pcg_dp_canonical_phase_duration_seconds{phase="retract"}` elevated
  → likely cause: large stale node set or missing index on `repo_id +
  evidence_source + generation_id` → check graph schema; retract Cypher uses
  DETACH DELETE which is proportional to edge volume.

- Symptom: `failure_class=graph_write_timeout` in queue rows → likely cause:
  `TimeoutExecutor.Timeout` too short for current write volume → check
  `TimeoutHint` in the error for the env var to adjust; check
  `pcg_dp_canonical_phase_duration_seconds` for the slow phase.

- Symptom: `pcg_dp_canonical_atomic_fallbacks_total` > 0 → the executor does
  not implement `GroupExecutor`; writes are sequential; investigate whether
  the wired executor is missing `ExecuteGroup`.

- Symptom: NornicDB MERGE unique constraint violation not retried → check
  `isNornicDBMergeUniqueConflict` in `retrying_executor.go:129`; the cypher
  string must contain MERGE and the error must match the expected message shape.

## Anti-patterns

- **Do not add `if backend == "nornicdb"` branches** in writers, statement
  builders, or callers. Backend dialect differences belong only in documented
  narrow seams (schema adapters, `cmd/` wiring, executor constructors).
- **Do not call Neo4j or NornicDB drivers directly** from inside this package.
  Concrete driver sessions belong in `cmd/` wiring.
- **Do not change `Executor` interface signature** without coordinating all
  `cmd/` wiring sites and the projector CanonicalWriter contract.
- **Do not use CREATE instead of MERGE** in canonical Cypher templates. CREATE
  breaks idempotency and will cause duplicate-node errors on retries.
- **Do not add `GroupExecutor` to `ExecuteOnlyExecutor`**. It intentionally
  hides the group path so callers during concurrent ingestion do not hold large
  atomic transactions.

## What NOT to change without an ADR

- `Executor` interface shape — changes break every `cmd/` wiring site and the
  projector CanonicalWriter contract; see
  `docs/docs/adrs/2026-04-22-nornicdb-graph-backend-candidate.md`.
- `CanonicalNodeWriter` phase order — phase ordering is a correctness constraint
  because later phases MATCH nodes created by earlier phases; see
  `docs/docs/adrs/2026-04-17-neo4j-deadlock-elimination-batch-isolation.md`.
- Retraction Cypher label sets — adding or removing node labels from retract
  queries requires coordinated graph schema migration.
- `RetryingExecutor` retry classification logic — NornicDB compatibility
  behavior is documented in `retrying_executor.go`; changes must be evidence-
  backed per the NornicDB maintainer patch bar.
