// Package postgres owns PCG's relational persistence: facts, queue state,
// content store, status, recovery data, decisions, and workflow
// coordination tables.
//
// The package wraps the Postgres driver with OTEL-instrumented helpers and
// exposes typed access to queue claim, lease, batch, and recovery
// operations. Callers must respect transaction scope, lease timing,
// idempotency keys, and partial-failure behavior documented on each
// helper; queue and status writes are retry-safe by design and must stay
// that way. Schema and queue contract changes require migration and a
// matching update to the recovery and status surfaces.
