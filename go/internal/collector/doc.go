// Package collector owns git collection, repository discovery, snapshot
// capture, and parser input shaping for PCG indexing runs.
//
// It turns source repositories into the inputs required by parser and fact
// emission: cloned snapshots, discovery reports, file selections, and entity
// metadata. The package is the source of truth for what files exist in a
// snapshot and the metadata attached to them; it does not make graph
// projection or query-time truth decisions, which belong to the projector,
// reducer, storage, and query packages. Callers must treat collection as
// best-effort over remote and local filesystems and handle partial-snapshot
// and discovery-skip outcomes explicitly.
