// Package graph defines the source-local graph write contract and the Cypher
// builders used by writers and schema bootstrap.
//
// Writer is the narrow per-scope-generation write interface; Materialization
// and Record are its inputs. The package also owns Cypher statement and
// executor types kept here to avoid an import cycle with storage/cypher,
// canonical entity merge builders, batched UNWIND helpers, the file and
// repository deletion mutations, and the EnsureSchema constraint and index
// contract for the Neo4j and NornicDB dialects.
