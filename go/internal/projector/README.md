# Projector

## Purpose

`projector` owns source-local projection stages. It turns committed fact
envelopes for one scope generation into canonical graph nodes, content store
rows, and reducer intents for shared-domain follow-up. It does not make
cross-source admission decisions — those belong to `internal/reducer`.

```

## Lifecycle / workflow

`Service.Run` starts one or more worker goroutines (sequential when `Workers`
≤ 1, concurrent otherwise). Each worker calls `ProjectorWorkSource.Claim` to
pull one `ScopeGenerationWork` from the Postgres projector queue. If nothing is
ready, the worker waits `PollInterval` (default 1 s) and retries.

Once a claim is held, the worker loads all fact envelopes for that scope
generation via `FactStore.LoadFacts`, then hands them to `Runtime.Project`. The
`Runtime` builds a `CanonicalMaterialization` (repository, directory, file,
entity, module, import, parameter, class member, and nested-function rows) and a
content materialization in a single pass via `buildProjection`. It writes
canonical nodes through `CanonicalWriter.Write`, publishes a
`graph_projection_phase_state` row via the `PhasePublisher` so reducer-owned
edge domains can gate on `canonical_nodes_committed`, writes content store rows,
and enqueues `ReducerIntent` values for shared domains such as
`DomainSemanticEntityMaterialization`.

On success the worker calls `ProjectorWorkSink.Ack`. On any error it calls
`ProjectorWorkSink.Fail` with a `FailureClassification` derived from
`ClassifyFailure`. A large-generation semaphore (`largeSem`) limits concurrent
projection of scope generations above `LargeGenThreshold` facts to
`LargeGenMaxConcurrent` workers to prevent memory pressure from many
high-cardinality repositories running at once.

## Exported surface

- `Service` — poll-and-dispatch loop; wire `ProjectorWorkSource`, `FactStore`,
  `ProjectionRunner`, `ProjectorWorkSink`, and optionally `ProjectorWorkHeartbeater`
  and `FactCounter` before calling `Service.Run`
- `Runtime` — implements `ProjectionRunner`; takes a `CanonicalWriter`,
  `content.Writer`, `ReducerIntentWriter`, `PhasePublisher`, and `RepairQueue`
- `CanonicalWriter` — interface for writing a `CanonicalMaterialization` to
  the canonical graph backend; implemented by `storage/cypher.CanonicalNodeWriter`
- `ReducerIntentWriter` — interface for enqueuing `ReducerIntent` rows to the
  reducer queue
- `CanonicalMaterialization` — full set of canonical node writes for one
  repository generation: `RepositoryRow`, `DirectoryRow`, `FileRow`,
  `EntityRow`, `ModuleRow`, `ImportRow`, `ParameterRow`, `ClassMemberRow`,
  `NestedFunctionRow`
- `ScopeGenerationWork` — one claimed queue item; carries `scope.IngestionScope`
  and `scope.ScopeGeneration`
- `Result` — output of one projection pass; includes `content.Result` and
  `IntentResult`
- `ReducerIntent` — one pending shared-domain work item emitted after projection
- `FailureClassification` — structured failure metadata (class, disposition,
  stage) used for durable queue persistence
- `ClassifyFailure(err, stage)` — maps a projection error to a
  `FailureClassification`; understands Neo4j transient codes, context
  cancellation, network errors, and sentinel error types
- `StageError`, `InputValidationError`, `ResourceExhaustedError` — typed errors
  the classifier recognizes
- `EntityTypeLabel(entityType)` — maps content-store entity type strings (e.g.
  `"function"`) to Neo4j node labels (e.g. `"Function"`)
- `EntityTypeLabelMap()` — returns a copy of the full entity-type-to-label
  mapping; used in schema conformance tests
- `ProjectFileStage`, `ProjectEntityStage`, `ProjectRelationshipStage`,
  `ProjectWorkloadStage` — stage helpers that project subsets of facts into
  typed results; useful in unit tests and stage-level benchmarks
- `FilterFileFacts`, `FilterEntityFacts`, `FilterRepositoryFacts` — deduplicated
  fact slices by kind
- `NormalizeFactKind` — strips the legacy `Fact` suffix from fact kind strings
- `BuildProjectionDecision`, `BuildProjectionEvidence` — build persisted
  decision rows for audit tracing
- `RetryableError`, `IsRetryable` — typed retry interface and predicate
- `RetryInjector`, `RetryOnceInjector`, `NewRetryOnceInjector` — fault-injection
  seam for controlled retry testing

See `doc.go` for the full godoc contract.

## Dependencies

- `internal/content` — `content.Writer`, `content.Materialization`,
  `content.Record`, `content.EntityRecord`; projector does not own content
  schema, only populates it
- `internal/facts` — `facts.Envelope`; the durable fact model projector reads
- `internal/queue` — `queue.FailureRecord`; `ClassifyFailure.ToFailureRecord`
  converts to this for queue persistence
- `internal/reducer` — `reducer.Domain`, `reducer.GraphProjectionPhasePublisher`,
  `reducer.GraphProjectionPhaseRepairQueue`, `reducer.GraphProjectionPhaseState`,
  `reducer.DomainSemanticEntityMaterialization`; projector emits intents and
  phase state that reducer consumes
- `internal/scope` — `scope.IngestionScope`, `scope.ScopeGeneration`; scope
  identity flows through every projection call
- `internal/telemetry` — span, metric, and log helpers

Graph writes route through `internal/storage/cypher.CanonicalNodeWriter` via the
`CanonicalWriter` interface. The projector never calls a Neo4j or NornicDB driver
directly.

## Telemetry

- Metrics: `pcg_dp_projector_run_duration_seconds` — duration of one full claim-
  to-ack cycle; `pcg_dp_projections_completed_total` — counter labeled `status`
  (`succeeded`/`failed`/`ack_failed`); `pcg_dp_projector_stage_duration_seconds`
  — labeled by `stage` (`build_projection`, `canonical_write`, `content_write`,
  `intent_enqueue`); `pcg_dp_queue_claim_duration_seconds` labeled `queue=projector`;
  `pcg_dp_canonical_writes_total` and `pcg_dp_canonical_write_duration_seconds` —
  canonical graph write counters; `pcg_dp_reducer_intents_enqueued_total` — intent
  queue output; `pcg_dp_large_repo_semaphore_wait_seconds` — semaphore wait for
  high-fact-count generations
- Spans: `telemetry.SpanProjectorRun` (`projector.run`) wraps each claim cycle;
  `telemetry.SpanCanonicalProjection` (`canonical.projection`) wraps the
  canonical write; `telemetry.SpanReducerIntentEnqueue` (`reducer_intent.enqueue`)
  wraps intent queue writes
- Logs: scope `projector`, phase `telemetry.PhaseProjection` (`projection`).
  Structured log events: `projector work stage completed` (load_facts and
  project_generation stages), `projector runtime stage completed` (build,
  canonical write, content write, intent enqueue), `projection succeeded`,
  `projection failed`, `projector work canceled during shutdown`. All events
  carry `scope_id`, `generation_id`, `source_system`, `worker_id`, `stage`,
  `duration_seconds`, and `failure_class` on error paths.

## Operational notes

- If `pcg_dp_projections_completed_total{status="failed"}` is rising, check
  `failure_class` in structured logs — `dependency_unavailable` with a Neo4j
  transient code is retryable; `projection_bug` or `input_invalid` needs
  investigation.
- `pcg_dp_projector_stage_duration_seconds{stage="canonical_write"}` shows
  whether the graph backend write is the bottleneck. If it is elevated, check
  `pcg_dp_canonical_write_duration_seconds` and graph backend metrics before
  raising worker count.
- `pcg_dp_projector_stage_duration_seconds{stage="content_write"}` covers the
  Postgres content-store write. When this stage dominates, check
  `pcg_dp_postgres_query_duration_seconds` for connection-pool pressure.
- `pcg_dp_large_repo_semaphore_wait_seconds` rising means large-generation
  slots are saturated; raise `LargeGenMaxConcurrent` cautiously and watch
  memory (see `pcg_dp_gomemlimit_bytes`).
- `pcg_dp_queue_oldest_age_seconds{queue="projector"}` aging means workers
  cannot keep up with ingest rate. Add projector workers or scale the runtime
  before changing graph-write timeouts.
- On `/admin/status`, `queue_blockages` indicates work is eligible but held due
  to a conflict key; distinguish this from graph backend slowness before
  changing concurrency settings.

## Extension points

- `CanonicalWriter` — wire a different backend by implementing this interface;
  the projector does not branch on backend brand
- `ProjectionRunner` — `Runtime` is the default implementation; tests substitute
  recording or failing runners
- `ProjectorWorkSource` / `ProjectorWorkSink` — implemented by the Postgres
  projector queue; can be replaced for isolated unit tests
- `RetryInjector` — `RetryOnceInjector` is the only production-shipped injector;
  add new implementations only for bounded fault-injection scenarios, not as a
  general retry mechanism

Do not add backend-conditional logic to `CanonicalWriter.Write` callers.
Backend dialect differences belong only in `internal/storage/cypher` and its
backend-specific adapters.

## Gotchas / invariants

- Projection must be idempotent (`doc.go`). Retries and re-queued items must
  converge on the same graph truth, not create second paths.
- `PhasePublisher.PublishGraphProjectionPhases` must succeed before the projector
  acks a work item. If publish fails and `RepairQueue` is wired, a repair row is
  enqueued so reducer can re-gate on phase state (`runtime.go:191`).
- `Module` and `Parameter` entity types are excluded from the generic
  `EntityRow` extraction path because they use different MERGE keys in the graph
  schema; they get their own extraction phases (`canonical_builder.go:227`).
- File paths in `EntityRow.FilePath` and `FileRow.Path` are repo-qualified
  (`repoPath/relative_path`) to prevent cross-repository MERGE collisions in the
  graph (`canonical_builder.go:112`).
- The `ContentBeforeCanonical` flag on `Runtime` writes the content index before
  graph projection. This is intentional only for local profiles where the graph
  backend may be degraded; do not set it in full-stack deployments
  (`runtime.go:36`).
- Directories in `CanonicalMaterialization.Directories` are sorted root-first
  by `Depth` so parent nodes exist before children during ordered writes
  (`canonical_builder.go:191`).
- `ReducerIntent` values are sorted by `Domain`, `EntityKey`, and `FactID`
  before enqueue to produce a stable queue order (`runtime.go:308`).
