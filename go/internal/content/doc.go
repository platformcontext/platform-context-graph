// Package content defines the source-local content write contract and the
// canonical content-entity identifier used by Postgres-backed writers.
//
// Writer is the narrow per-scope-generation interface; Materialization,
// Record, and EntityRecord are its inputs. WriterConfig and LoadWriterConfig
// expose the PCG_CONTENT_ENTITY_BATCH_SIZE tunable. CanonicalEntityID hashes
// (repoID, relativePath, entityType, entityName, lineNumber) into a stable
// "content-entity:e_<12-hex>" identifier with BLAKE2s.
