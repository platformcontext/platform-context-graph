// Package status owns the shared reporting shape for PCG pipeline state,
// backlog, generation lifecycle, and request-lifecycle health.
//
// Types in this package project raw runtime counts and lifecycle events
// into operator-facing reports consumed by the CLI, HTTP admin surfaces,
// and runtime status views. Keep these surfaces aligned: operators should
// not need a different mental model for each PCG service. JSON shapes here
// are part of the operator contract and must change in lockstep with the
// CLI reference and runtime admin docs.
