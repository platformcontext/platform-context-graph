// Package workflow defines the durable contracts for the workflow control
// plane: runs, work items, claims, collector instances, completeness states,
// and the reducer-facing phase contract per collector family.
//
// Types here are storage-neutral value contracts with Validate methods that
// enforce identity, status-lifecycle, and timestamp invariants. ControlStore
// is the durable surface implemented by storage/postgres. ReconcileRunProgress
// derives run status and completeness rows deterministically from bounded
// collector progress and reducer phase publications, and the family fairness
// scheduler chooses the next claim target across enabled collector instances.
