// Package explain renders one engine result as a stable, line-oriented text
// block for the explain API and operator-facing diagnostics.
//
// `Render` produces a deterministic header line, sorted match-count lines,
// sorted rejection-reason lines, and sorted evidence lines. Output ordering
// is part of the contract: the explain API and golden tests rely on it.
// This package does not evaluate rules or apply admission; it only formats
// what the engine has already decided.
