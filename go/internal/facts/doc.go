// Package facts defines the durable fact models and queue contracts that PCG
// writes before graph projection.
//
// Facts are the contract between collection, parsing, queueing, projection,
// and reducer-owned materialization. Types in this package describe source
// truth in a form that survives retries, repair, and replay; consumers must
// treat fact identifiers and shapes as stable on-disk records. New fields
// must be additive and back-compatible, and convenience fields that only
// help one caller belong elsewhere.
