// Package main runs the pcg-bootstrap-index binary, which performs a
// one-shot end-to-end indexing pass: collection, source-local projection,
// relationship-evidence backfill, deployment-mapping reopen, and IaC
// reachability materialization.
//
// When invoked with --version or -v, it prints the embedded application
// version through the test-covered printBootstrapIndexVersionFlag helper and
// exits before opening stores. Otherwise the binary opens Postgres and the graph backend, runs collector and
// projector goroutines concurrently against a Postgres FOR UPDATE SKIP
// LOCKED queue, and then drives the post-collection passes that the
// facts-first ordering documented in CLAUDE.md requires. It exits when the
// queue drains; it is not a steady-state runtime and does not mount the
// shared `/healthz`, `/readyz`, or `/admin/status` admin surface.
