// Package main runs the pcg-api binary, which serves the PCG HTTP query and
// admin surface backed by the configured graph backend and Postgres content
// store.
//
// When invoked with --version or -v, it prints the embedded application
// version and exits before runtime setup. Otherwise the binary boots OTEL
// telemetry, wires the query router and the shared
// runtime admin mux, and listens on PCG_API_ADDR (default :8080) wrapped in
// otelhttp instrumentation. On SIGINT or SIGTERM it gives the HTTP server up
// to five seconds for graceful shutdown before exiting. The runtime serves
// reads only; it does not own repo sync, parsing, fact emission, or queued
// projection work.
