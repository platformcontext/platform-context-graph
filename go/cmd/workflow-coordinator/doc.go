// Package main runs the pcg-workflow-coordinator binary, the long-running
// runtime that reconciles declarative collector instance state and, in
// active mode, reaps expired claims and recomputes workflow-run completeness.
//
// When invoked with --version or -v, it prints the embedded application
// version and exits before runtime setup. Otherwise the binary boots OTEL
// telemetry, opens Postgres, builds coordinator.Service
// from the configured store and metrics, and hosts it through
// app.NewHostedWithStatusServer so it exposes the shared `/healthz`,
// `/readyz`, `/metrics`, and `/admin/status` admin surface. Deployment mode
// (dark by default, active when the deployment knobs documented in the
// runtime contract are set) gates the reap and run-reconciliation loops;
// trigger normalization and permanent claim ownership are not implemented in
// this binary today. SIGINT and SIGTERM trigger clean shutdown through the
// hosted runtime drain.
package main
