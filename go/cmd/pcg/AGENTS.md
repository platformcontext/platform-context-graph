# AGENTS.md — cmd/pcg guidance for LLM assistants

## Read first

1. `go/cmd/pcg/README.md` — binary purpose, subcommand groups, configuration,
   and gotchas
2. `go/cmd/pcg/root.go` — `rootCmd`, persistent flags (`--database`,
   `--visual`), and root subcommand registration
3. `go/cmd/pcg/service.go` — `runMCPStart`, `runAPIStart`, `pcgExec`,
   `pcgExecutable`; how the binary execs runtime processes
4. `go/cmd/pcg/basic.go` — indexing subcommands (`index`, `list`, `watch`,
   `query`, `stats`); `runIndex` delegates to `pcg-bootstrap-index` via
   `indexLookPath`
5. `go/cmd/pcg/graph.go` — `graph` subcommand tree, `graphStatusOutput`,
   `graphStatusForLayout`, `runGraphStart`, `runGraphStop`

## Invariants this package enforces

- **`SilenceUsage` and `SilenceErrors`** — set on `rootCmd` so Cobra does not
  print usage on every error. Removing these breaks operator scripts that
  parse `stderr`. Enforced at `root.go:31-32`.
- **`--database` mutates the process environment** — `PersistentPreRunE` on
  `rootCmd` calls `os.Setenv("PCG_RUNTIME_DB_TYPE", globalDatabase)`. This
  affects every child process exec'd in the same process. Enforced at
  `root.go:35`.
- **Service-launch via `syscall.Exec`** — `pcg mcp start` (stdio path),
  `pcg api start`, and `pcg graph start` replace the current process image via
  `pcgExec` (backed by `syscall.Exec`). No PCG logic runs after the exec
  point. Enforced in `service.go` and `graph.go`.
- **Removed commands use `removedCommandError`** — deprecated and removed
  commands (`delete`, `clean`, `unwatch`, `add-package`, `finalize`) call
  `removedCommandError` in `contract.go` instead of silently succeeding or
  panicking. Any new removal must follow this pattern.

## Common changes and how to scope them

- **Add a new `admin` subcommand** → add a `cobra.Command` in `admin.go`,
  wire it to `adminCmd` or `adminFactsCmd`, call `apiClientFromCmd` for
  authenticated requests. Why: `admin.go` owns the full admin subcommand tree;
  scattering admin commands into other files makes auditing harder.

- **Add a new `graph` subcommand** → add a `cobra.Command` to `graph.go`'s
  `init()` and add its `run*` func in the same file. Why: the `graph`
  subcommand tree is fully wired in `graph.go`; the `graphCmd` var is defined
  there.

- **Add a new persistent flag** → add it in `root.go` and thread it through
  `PersistentPreRunE` if it affects child-process env. Why: persistent flags
  apply to all subcommands; adding them only in a leaf file makes them
  invisible to sibling commands.

- **Add a new local-host subcommand** → add a `cobra.Command` inside the
  `init()` in `local_host.go`; keep the command `Hidden: true`. Why:
  `local-host` is the internal supervisor entry point, not a public user
  command.

## Failure modes and how to debug

- Symptom: `pcg mcp start` prints `pcg-mcp-server binary not found in PATH`
  → cause: `exec.LookPath("pcg-mcp-server")` failed; rebuild with
  `cd go && go build -o bin/ ./cmd/mcp-server/` and add `go/bin` to `PATH`.

- Symptom: `pcg index` prints `pcg-bootstrap-index binary not found in PATH`
  → cause: `indexLookPath("pcg-bootstrap-index")` failed; rebuild
  `./cmd/bootstrap-index/` and ensure `go/bin` is on `PATH`.

- Symptom: `pcg graph start` starts a process but the graph does not come up
  → cause: `pcg-reducer` or `pcg-ingester` are not on `PATH`; the
  `local-host watch` supervisor discovers them through `PATH`. Rebuild all
  binaries and check `PATH` before running.

- Symptom: a `pcg admin` command returns a non-200 response → cause: the
  `APIClient` target URL is wrong or the API server is down; check the
  service URL config and that `pcg api start` is running.

## Anti-patterns specific to this package

- **Business logic in subcommand `RunE` functions** — `RunE` functions should
  call `apiClientFromCmd`, `pcgExec`, or a delegating helper. Domain logic
  (graph writes, fact queries, schema checks) belongs in the `internal/*`
  packages that own those surfaces.

- **Direct driver or Postgres calls in this package** — this binary is a CLI
  dispatcher. It must not open Postgres or graph driver connections except
  through `internal/runtime` helpers already used here. All data-plane work
  runs in the launched binaries.

- **Adding a hidden command without tests** — hidden `local-host` subcommands
  have integration-level tests in `local_host_supervision_test.go` and
  `service_local_test.go`. New hidden commands need coverage before merging.

## What NOT to change without an ADR

- The `local-host watch` and `local-host mcp-stdio` subcommand contract — the
  `pcg mcp start` and `pcg graph start` paths hard-code these subcommand names
  when calling `pcgExec`; renaming them silently breaks both flows.
- The `--database` flag name and its effect on `PCG_RUNTIME_DB_TYPE` — external
  scripts and the local-authoritative profile depend on this flag; see
  `docs/docs/reference/cli-reference.md`.
