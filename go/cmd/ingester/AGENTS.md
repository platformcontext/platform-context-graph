# AGENTS.md — cmd/ingester guidance for LLM assistants

## Read first

1. `go/cmd/ingester/README.md` — pipeline position, lifecycle, env vars,
   and operational notes
2. `go/cmd/ingester/main.go` — `run` function; understand bootstrap order
   before touching wiring
3. `go/cmd/ingester/wiring.go` — `buildIngesterService`, `compositeRunner`,
   `buildIngesterCollectorService`, `buildIngesterProjectorService`; the two
   services run concurrently under a shared cancel context
4. `go/internal/collector/README.md` and `go/internal/projector/README.md` —
   understand both services before modifying their wiring
5. `go/cmd/ingester/wiring_nornicdb_env.go` and `wiring_nornicdb_config.go` —
   NornicDB knobs; read before adding or changing any PCG_NORNICDB_* variable

## Invariants this package enforces

- **Single workspace owner** — the ingester is the only runtime that should
  hold the workspace PVC. Do not add PVC mounts to other workloads.
- **AfterBatchDrained ordering** — `BackfillAllRelationshipEvidence` must run
  before `ReopenDeploymentMappingWorkItems`. Both must succeed; a failure exits
  the ingester. This implements CLAUDE.md Phase 1 / Phase 3 bootstrap ordering.
  Enforced in `wiring.go:ingesterDeferredRelationshipMaintenance`.
- **SkipRelationshipBackfill = true** on `IngestionStore` — per-commit backfill
  is suppressed deliberately. Do not remove this flag without adding equivalent
  per-commit backfill, which would slow the hot commit path.
- **compositeRunner first-error cancel** — either service failing cancels the
  other via the shared context. This is correct behavior; do not change it to
  ignore collector or projector errors.
- **Signal-driven shutdown** — `signal.NotifyContext(SIGINT, SIGTERM)` is the
  only supported shutdown path. Do not add alternate shutdown mechanisms.

## Common changes and how to scope them

- **Add a new graph backend** → add `wiring_<backend>_executor.go` and
  `wiring_<backend>_env.go` following the NornicDB pattern; handle the new
  `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND` value in `openIngesterCanonicalWriter`; update
  `docs/docs/reference/nornicdb-tuning.md` if new tuning knobs are added.
  Do not branch on backend inside `buildIngesterService` or `buildIngesterProjectorService`.

- **Add a new NornicDB tuning knob** → add the env var constant in `wiring.go`
  alongside the existing `nornicDBCanonicalGroupedWritesEnv` constants, add the
  reader in `wiring_nornicdb_env.go`, pass the value through
  `openIngesterCanonicalWriter`, and update `docs/docs/reference/nornicdb-tuning.md`
  and the active NornicDB ADR in the same PR. See CLAUDE.md NornicDB
  Compatibility Workflow.

- **Change projector worker defaults** → edit `projectorWorkerCount` in
  `wiring.go`; add a test in `wiring_nornicdb_phase_group_test.go` or a new
  file; read the projector README concurrency guidance first.

- **Add a new admin route** → wire through `app.NewHostedWithStatusServer`
  options in `main.go`; do not add bespoke HTTP bootstrap code outside that
  call.

## Failure modes and how to debug

- Symptom: ingester exits immediately after start →
  likely cause: `openIngesterCanonicalWriter` or `OpenPostgres` failed →
  check structured logs for `telemetry bootstrap`, `open postgres`, or
  `build ingester` errors; verify Bolt URI and Postgres DSN are set.

- Symptom: `pcg_dp_repos_snapshotted_total{status="failed"}` rising →
  likely cause: git clone failure, discovery error, or parse error →
  check `collector snapshot stage completed` logs for `stage=discovery` or
  `stage=parse` error fields; check workspace disk pressure and git credentials.

- Symptom: projector queue age growing after ingester restart →
  likely cause: projector workers cannot drain as fast as collection fills →
  check `pcg_dp_projector_stage_duration_seconds{stage="canonical_write"}`;
  raise `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS` only after confirming graph backend is not the
  bottleneck.

- Symptom: ingester exits with "deferred relationship backfill failed" →
  likely cause: `BackfillAllRelationshipEvidence` Postgres error →
  check Postgres connection health and fact-store table constraints; the exit is
  intentional to prevent partial backfill state.

- Symptom: NornicDB write timeout in logs →
  likely cause: `PCG_CANONICAL_WRITE_TIMEOUT` too short for current entity
  density or NornicDB is under memory pressure →
  check `nornicdb-tuning.md` for per-label batch size guidance before
  increasing the timeout blindly.

## Anti-patterns specific to this package

- **Branching on `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND` inside `buildIngesterService`** — backend
  selection belongs only in `openIngesterCanonicalWriter` and the
  `wiring_<backend>_*.go` files. The collector and projector services are
  backend-agnostic.

- **Attaching the workspace PVC to another runtime** — the ingester is the
  single owner. Sharing the PVC causes write conflicts under concurrent git
  operations.

- **Running `AfterBatchDrained` logic inline in the per-commit path** —
  backfill must be deferred to after the full batch drain, not per-commit.
  Per-commit backfill is the design that `SkipRelationshipBackfill = true`
  intentionally avoids.

- **Setting PCG_NORNICDB_CANONICAL_GROUPED_WRITES=true in production before
  conformance** — this flag is gated on the fixed rollback binary and a full
  conformance pass. Using it prematurely can produce partial writes.

## What NOT to change without an ADR

- `AfterBatchDrained` call order (`BackfillAllRelationshipEvidence` before
  `ReopenDeploymentMappingWorkItems`) — changing this order breaks the
  bootstrap phase contract in `CLAUDE.md`.
- `compositeRunner` error propagation — silencing either service error hides
  real failures from operators.
- The workspace PVC ownership model — moving workspace ownership to another
  runtime requires a coordinated deployment change and an ADR documenting
  the new ownership boundary.
