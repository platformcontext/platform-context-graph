# Cross-Repo Contract Bridge And Service Dependency Graph Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED: Use `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task. Use `karpathy-guidelines` and `google-go-best-practices` for every Go change.

**Goal:** Add a conservative cross-repo contract bridge for HTTP, gRPC, events, schemas, generated clients, and shared libraries, then feed contract edges into dependency neighborhoods and change-impact summaries.

**Architecture:** Start with normalized contract identities and exact/derived matching rules. Persist provider and consumer evidence as durable facts, resolve matches in reducer-owned batches, and expose contract impact only with truth labels and ambiguity reasons.

**Tech Stack:** Go parser/extractor packages, PostgreSQL facts, reducer materialization, graph/query ports, MCP/CLI/docs, OTEL telemetry

**Related spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-cross-repo-contract-bridge-and-service-dependency-graph-design.md`
**Related ADR:** `docs/docs/adrs/2026-04-24-iac-usage-reachability-and-refactor-impact.md`

---

## Core Goals

1. **Accuracy:** exact matches require stable contract identities; string-only evidence stays derived or unresolved.
2. **Concurrency:** contract resolution batches by generation, family, and identity partition; no global resolver lock.
3. **Speed:** normalize once, index by contract key, and cap high-fanout query expansion.
4. **Instrumentation:** emit extraction, resolution, ambiguity, fanout, and query metrics without route/topic/path labels.

## Rigor Addendum

**Current flow:** parsers and relationship extractors emit provider/consumer evidence; fact storage persists evidence by repository generation; reducer batches resolve normalized identities into contract edges; query surfaces read those edges for neighborhoods, change-impact, MCP, CLI, and UI.

**Shared state:** contract fact tables, reducer queues, graph projection readiness, repository generation snapshots, service boundary assignments, manifest-declared links, indexes on family/key/role/generation, and telemetry instruments.

**Transaction and retry boundaries:** extraction writes facts idempotently per repo/generation; reducer claims one family/key/generation partition at a time; graph writes happen after fact resolution commits. Retries must be idempotent and must not advance freshness for missing or stale repositories.

**Deadlock, race, and ordering hazards:** avoid a global resolver mutex, opposite-order updates across provider and consumer partitions, mixed-generation matches without labels, stale bridge reads after partial sync, duplicate edges from manifest and derived matches, and fanout that starves other reducer domains. Preserve concurrency with partitioned claims and deterministic write ordering by family, normalized key, repository, and role.

**Edge cases:** missing repositories, stale indexed generations, dangling manifest links, duplicate providers, one provider with many consumers, generated clients without source provenance, wildcard gRPC or topic matches, string-only HTTP URLs, repository renames, contract deletions, and unsupported cross-depth requests.

**Observability contract:** operators must see extraction coverage, missing repositories, stale generations, claim lag, resolution latency, ambiguity, fanout, skipped edges, partial cross-impact, timeout, and error class without route, topic, schema, package, or repository path labels.
