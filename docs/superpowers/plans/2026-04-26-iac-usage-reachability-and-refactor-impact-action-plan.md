# IaC Usage Reachability And Refactor Impact Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED: Use `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task. Use `karpathy-guidelines` and `google-go-best-practices` for every Go change.

**Goal:** Implement the IaC usage, reachability, integrity, and refactor-impact graph from the related ADR without weakening PCG truth labels or reducer concurrency.

**Architecture:** Add durable IaC reference facts first, then materialize typed usage edges through reducer-owned phases, and expose query surfaces only after parser, projector, reducer, and query contracts have tests. Keep the first release static and source-backed; renderer-backed proof is opt-in and must report partial coverage when unavailable.

**Tech Stack:** Go, PostgreSQL fact store, graph adapter ports, Neo4j/NornicDB-compatible query paths, OTEL telemetry, MkDocs

**Related ADR:** `docs/docs/adrs/2026-04-24-iac-usage-reachability-and-refactor-impact.md`

---

## Core Goals

1. **Accuracy:** never label IaC dead unless root reachability and domain semantics support it.
2. **Concurrency:** reducer work is bounded by repo/generation/family and must not serialize unrelated repositories.
3. **Speed:** use batched reference extraction, batched fact writes, and bounded graph traversals.
4. **Instrumentation:** every parser, reducer, and query phase emits operator-visible spans, counters, histograms, and structured limitations.

## Rigor Addendum

**Current flow:** parsers and content relationship builders emit IaC reference evidence; facts persist by repo and generation; reducer materializes usage edges after generation-scoped readiness; query, MCP, CLI, and future UI consumers read deadness, integrity, relationships, and refactor impact with truth labels.

**Shared state:** IaC fact tables, reducer queues, graph projection readiness rows, source spans, generated renderer artifacts when enabled, graph edges, OpenAPI schemas, and telemetry instruments.

**Transaction and retry boundaries:** parser extraction is deterministic and side-effect free; fact writes are idempotent per repo/generation/source selector; reducer claims are partitioned by repo/generation/family; graph writes occur after fact persistence. Retries must preserve stable IDs and must not mark a stale generation as current.

**Deadlock, race, and ordering hazards:** avoid global reducer locks, mixed-generation reads, duplicate materialization from parser and content evidence, renderer output racing with parser-only results, and claim ordering that conflicts with other reducer domains. Preserve concurrency by processing unrelated repo/generation/family partitions independently.

**Edge cases:** dynamic HCL expressions, remote modules, missing local paths, renderer unavailable, partial renderer failure, stale generations, duplicate references, ambiguous roots, generated files, deleted targets, optional resources, provider-specific semantics, and unsupported graph adapters.

**Observability contract:** operators must see extraction counts, unresolved references, stale generation skips, reducer claim lag, queue depth, materialization latency, partial renderer coverage, high-fanout traversal, truncation, unsupported capability, and error class without file path or resource name labels.

## Assumptions

1. Phase 0 neighborhood work can start with existing code and content relationships, but exact IaC deadness waits for durable usage facts.
2. Existing content relationship builders are evidence sources, not the final durable usage model.
3. Renderer-backed Helm/Kustomize validation is optional in the first pass and must not block parser-only results.

## Final Verification

Run:

```bash
cd go && go test ./internal/facts ./internal/parser ./internal/relationships ./internal/storage/postgres ./internal/reducer ./internal/query ./internal/mcp ./cmd/pcg -count=1
uv run --with mkdocs --with mkdocs-material --with pymdown-extensions mkdocs build --strict --clean --config-file docs/mkdocs.yml
```

Expected: all commands exit 0. If any test is skipped because it requires compose or local-authoritative services, document the exact reason and the replacement proof.
