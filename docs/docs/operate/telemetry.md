# Telemetry

PCG exposes four operator views:

- metrics for rates, latency, backlog, concurrency, and capacity
- traces for request and pipeline timing
- structured JSON logs for repository, run, work item, and failure context
- `/admin/status` for live stage, queue state, and failure summaries

## What To Watch

| Symptom | First signal | Next signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API or MCP is slow | request metrics | traces and runtime logs |
| Queue backlog is rising | queue depth and oldest-age metrics | reducer `/admin/status` |
| One repo is slow | ingester metrics | discovery report and collector logs |
| Graph writes are slow | reducer and graph-write metrics | graph backend traces/logs |
| Replay or dead-letter behavior looks wrong | recovery metrics | `/admin/status` and recovery logs |

Go data-plane metrics use the `pcg_dp_` prefix. Runtime status gauges use the
`pcg_runtime_` prefix.

Docker Compose exposes Prometheus-format metrics on the runtime ports listed in
[Health Checks](health-checks.md). Add `docker-compose.telemetry.yml` when you
want a local OpenTelemetry collector and Jaeger at `http://localhost:16686` for
developer or DevOps testing.
