# Connect MCP

MCP is the assistant-facing path into PCG. Use it when Claude, Codex, Cursor,
VS Code, or another MCP client needs indexed code, deployment, and
infrastructure context.

PCG can serve MCP in three ways:

| Shape | Use it when | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local owner stdio | You want one local workspace owner | `pcg mcp start --workspace-root <repo>` |
| Docker Compose MCP service | You want the full local stack on your laptop | `http://localhost:8081` by default |
| Deployed MCP service | You want assistants to query shared indexed state | Deployed `mcp-server` runtime |

## Local owner MCP

```bash
pcg mcp start --workspace-root /path/to/repo
```

## Compose MCP

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The Compose API listens on `http://localhost:8080` by default. The Compose MCP
service listens on `http://localhost:8081` by default. Point MCP clients at the
MCP service, not the API service.

## Client setup

Use:

```bash
pcg mcp setup
```

Then configure your MCP client for the local owner, Compose MCP service, or
deployed MCP endpoint. Restart the client after changing MCP configuration.

## What to ask

- "Use PCG to find this symbol and its callers."
- "Use PCG to trace this service to its Kubernetes and Terraform evidence."
- "Use PCG to explain the blast radius of this change."
- "Use PCG to list the indexed repositories."
