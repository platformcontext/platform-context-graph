# ADR: Reducer Throughput And NornicDB Concurrency Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Proposed

- `2026-04-22-nornicdb-graph-backend-candidate.md`
- `docs/docs/reference/nornicdb-tuning.md`
- `docs/docs/reference/telemetry/index.md`

## Decision

Treat reducer throughput as an architecture track, not as another round of
timeout and batch-size tuning.

The next phase will:

1. preserve graph correctness gates,
2. measure reducer queue wait, actual work time, and conflict blocking,
3. remove false serialization from reducer claim/routing policy,
4. make shared projection lanes partitionable by the real conflict unit,
5. tune the highest-cost Cypher shapes and NornicDB lookup paths from evidence,
6. only then raise worker or pod concurrency as a default.

This ADR does not accept "run fewer workers" as the end state. Sequential or
low-worker settings remain diagnostic tools for isolating correctness bugs, not
the desired production architecture.

## Context

The 2026-04-28 remote full-corpus proof ran against the 896-repository corpus
on a 16-vCPU, 128 GiB VM with Docker. The run completed without failed or
dead-lettered reducer work, but the wall clock was unacceptable:

- `896` repositories collected in about `6m30s`.
- Source-local projection finished by about `22m26s`.
- The reducer queue drained in about `7h43m40s`.
- Persisted queue state ended healthy: all `9182` work items succeeded.
- Only `14` retries were recorded, so this was not primarily a retry storm.

The strongest measured signal is that wall time was dominated by reducer queue
wait behind a small number of expensive graph-write domains:

| Domain | Items | Domain wall | Sum actual work | P95 queue wait |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `source_local` | 896 | `22m26s` | `44m30s` | `25.1s` |
| `semantic_entity_materialization` | 372 | `7h39m58s` | `49h12m48s` | `5h03m42s` |
| `workload_materialization` | 2538 | `7h16m24s` | `3h36m11s` | `6h18m52s` |
| `sql_relationship_materialization` | 896 | `7h42m36s` | `1h09m18s` | `4h19m12s` |
| `deployment_mapping` | 896 | `5h50m04s` | `31m58s` | `4h10m35s` |
| `code_call_materialization` | 896 | `5h46m41s` | `1m43s` | `4h01m43s` |

The top semantic reducers were heavily skewed. One repository took almost four
hours of semantic work by itself, while other domains showed low actual work
but multi-hour queue wait. That means most of the corpus was not slow because
every item was expensive; it was slow because the queue and graph-write shape
let a few hot items dominate the tail.

## Current Flow

The relevant runtime path is:

```text
ingester
  -> commits facts to Postgres
  -> enqueues source-local projector work

projector
  -> claims scope/generation work with leases
  -> builds source-local canonical graph/content projection
  -> writes canonical graph and content store
  -> enqueues reducer intents

reducer
  -> claims fact_work_items with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
  -> executes domain handlers
  -> writes graph/content/readiness side effects
  -> heartbeats long work
  -> acks, retries, or fails work

shared projection runners
  -> process code calls, repo dependency, shared edges, and repair lanes
  -> gate graph edges behind semantic-node readiness where required
```

Correctness constraints that must remain true:

- semantic nodes must exist before semantic edges depend on them,
- same-scope generations must not overlap destructive graph rewrite phases,
- repo-wide retracts must remain exclusive with writes that depend on the same
  repo generation,
- retries must remain idempotent,
- failed or stale claims must not ack work they no longer own,
- graph/API truth must match persisted fact intent after the run completes.

## Findings

### 1. The bottleneck is not collection alone

Collection and source-local work are significant, but they do not explain a
`7h43m` run. Source-local finished in about `22m26s`; the dominant tail was the
reducer and shared projection work that followed.

### 2. Queue wait hides the true hot path

Several domains had small summed work but multi-hour wall time. That points to
claim ordering, conflict routing, or shared worker lane serialization. A fast
domain waiting four hours is evidence of false or overly broad serialization,
not evidence that the fast domain needs tuning.

### 3. Semantic entity graph writes are the largest measured cost

`semantic_entity_materialization` accumulated about `49h12m` of worker time.
This is the first domain that needs query-shape and backend-path analysis. The
slowest repos were not ordered purely by entity count, so row volume alone is
not the full explanation.

### 4. Existing conflict domains are safe but coarse

The current reducer has useful fences, including row leases, generation gates,
and conflict-key routing. The problem is that several conflict keys are broader
than the actual correctness unit. That protects truth, but it also serializes
work that could run concurrently.

### 5. NornicDB should not be treated as a black box

NornicDB can execute concurrent transactions, but write throughput still
depends on exact Cypher shape, lookup indexes, relationship-existence probes,
MVCC validation, Badger commit ordering, and cache/index contention. Raising
workers without understanding these paths can amplify contention instead of
improving throughput.

### 6. Some PCG Cypher shapes are likely too broad for NornicDB

The highest-risk shapes are:

- multi-label semantic edge anchors,
- repo-wide retracts that filter by `repo_id` without a strong label/index
  anchor,
- workload dependency reads with `OR` predicates across source and target,
- shared-edge retractions that scan broad label families,
- relationship `MERGE` paths that repeatedly probe existing edges.

Neo4j may hide some of this with planner behavior and mature indexes. NornicDB
is forcing PCG to make those assumptions explicit, which is good engineering as
long as we keep the fixes behind backend-safe seams.

## Plan

### Phase 0: Baseline And Guardrails

Status: `in progress`

- Record the full-corpus baseline in this ADR.
- Keep the remote run artifacts and queue SQL used for timing analysis.
- Do not run the full corpus as the first proof for each change.
- Use this proof ladder instead:
  1. one large failing or slow repository,
  2. one small repository,
  3. one mixed 20-25 repository corpus,
  4. one 100 repository corpus,
  5. the full 896 repository corpus.

Exit criteria:

- every proof reports wall clock, queue state, failed/dead-letter counts, and
  top slow domains,
- graph/API truth checks remain green for the changed domain.

### Phase 1: Reducer Observability

Status: `in progress`

Add operator-visible reducer telemetry before changing scheduling semantics:

- work item queue wait versus actual handler duration,
- blocked-by-conflict counts and durations,
- conflict domain and conflict key in structured logs or metrics,
- eligible-but-not-claimed counts where the queue skips work,
- per-domain p50/p95/max handler duration,
- top N slow work items by repo and domain in status or run summary,
- shared projection partition wait and processing duration.

This phase answers: "Are workers idle because there is no eligible work, because
conflict keys are too broad, or because the graph backend is slow?"

### Phase 2: Conflict-Domain Matrix

Status: `planned`

Create an explicit matrix for each reducer domain:

| Domain | Reads | Writes | True conflict unit | Current conflict unit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `semantic_entity_materialization` | content entities, facts | semantic nodes | repo generation + label/write family | to verify |
| `code_call_materialization` | semantic nodes, call facts | `CALLS` edges | acceptance unit or repo edge family | to verify |
| `sql_relationship_materialization` | SQL facts, semantic nodes | SQL edges | repo + SQL edge family | to verify |
| `workload_materialization` | resolved relationships, workload facts | workload instances | deployment/service scope | to verify |
| `deployment_mapping` | relationship evidence | resolved relationships | deployment repo generation | to verify |

Then narrow only the conflict keys that are provably broader than the real
write/read dependency.

Required edge cases:

- stale generation followed by current generation,
- retry after partial graph write,
- same repo with two queued generations,
- two repos with identical entity names,
- repo-wide retract concurrent with edge upsert,
- slow worker lease expiry and reclaim.

### Phase 3: Shared Runner Partitioning

Status: `planned`

The shared projection runners must stop behaving like global lanes when the
data model allows narrower ownership.

Planned changes:

- give each reducer process a unique lease owner before multi-pod scaling,
- partition code-call projection by acceptance unit or source repo,
- partition repo dependency projection by repo pair or repo scope,
- preserve repo-wide retract exclusivity,
- keep semantic-node-readiness gates intact,
- add ack/fail/heartbeat fencing checks before increasing reducer pods.

This phase is complete only when multiple workers can drain independent graph
families without producing duplicate edges, missing edges, or stale-generation
acks.

### Phase 4: Cypher And Index Hot-Path Work

Status: `planned`

Use `cypher-query-rigor` rules: understand the data distribution and the graph
shape before rewriting queries.

First target: `sql_relationship_materialization`.

Why first:

- it is slow enough to matter,
- its label families are known,
- it is less semantically broad than code-call projection,
- it exercises the same multi-label anchor problem likely affecting other
  semantic edge domains.

Candidate work:

- add NornicDB lookup indexes for hot `repo_id` anchors where query evidence
  proves scans,
- split multi-label source/target anchors into concrete label-specific
  statements,
- replace broad `OR` workload dependency reads with indexed outgoing and
  incoming queries,
- split repo-wide retracts by label family when that improves anchor quality,
- add static tests that reject NornicDB query shapes known to force scans.

Proof must compare current and proposed Cypher on seeded data before the full
corpus run.

### Phase 5: NornicDB Backend Collaboration

Status: `planned`

Continue upstream-first work when PCG exposes a true NornicDB limitation.

Candidate backend improvements:

- validate and promote the direct edge-between lookup index work,
- add observability for index hit/miss, edge-existence probe fanout, commit
  latency, MVCC validation time, and conflict reason,
- benchmark PCG's exact `UNWIND/MERGE` write shapes at `1/2/4/8/16` workers,
- evaluate bulk upsert APIs only after query-shape fixes prove insufficient,
- avoid PCG-side workarounds when a small upstream backend fix is the correct
  long-term answer.

### Phase 6: Controlled Concurrency Increase

Status: `planned`

After Phases 1-4 expose the true safe overlap, test:

- `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS=8`,
- `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS=16`,
- batch claim size equal to worker count,
- shared projection workers `8-16`,
- shared projection partitions `16-32`,
- multiple reducer pods only after unique lease ownership and fencing are
  proven.

Higher worker counts should be adopted only when they reduce wall clock without
raising retry rate, dead letters, graph inconsistency, or NornicDB conflict
frequency.

## Acceptance Criteria

The reducer throughput phase is complete when:

- the 20-25 repo mixed corpus drains in less than `10m`,
- the 100 repo corpus drains in less than `30m`,
- the 896 repo corpus drains in less than `90m`, with a stretch target near the
  existing production expectation of `45m-55m`,
- failed and dead-letter queue counts remain `0`,
- graph/API truth checks pass for semantic entities, code calls, SQL
  relationships, workloads, and deployment mapping,
- the status surface can explain the slowest active domain without log mining,
- worker utilization drops only when no safe eligible work remains.

## Non-Goals

- Do not make NornicDB sequential reducer writes the final architecture.
- Do not blindly default worker count to vCPU count without conflict evidence.
- Do not tune timeouts as the primary solution.
- Do not remove semantic readiness gates to make wall-clock numbers look
  better.
- Do not run the full corpus for every speculative change.
- Do not add backend-specific branches outside documented adapter seams.

## Risks

- Narrowing conflict keys incorrectly can produce duplicate or missing graph
  edges.
- Increasing workers can worsen NornicDB contention if query shapes still scan
  or relationship probes remain expensive.
- Additional indexes can improve reads and writes while also increasing write
  amplification.
- Multi-pod reducers are unsafe until lease owners and ack/fail fencing are
  process-unique.
- Overfitting to one noisy repo can hide corpus-level behavior; every focused
  optimization still needs medium-corpus proof.

## Open Questions

- Which reducer domains are blocked by conflict policy versus graph write time?
- Which NornicDB writes are scanning despite available indexes?
- What is the safe partition key for code-call and repo-dependency shared
  runners?
- Does direct edge-between indexing remove the relationship `MERGE` hot path,
  or do PCG Cypher shapes still need label-specific splitting?
- How much of the tail remains after semantic entity graph writes are fixed?

## Phase 1 Runtime Evidence

The clean 20-repo proof after stopping outstanding remote runs used PCG
`0aa345d1`, rebuilt `pcg`, `pcg-api`, `pcg-ingester`, and `pcg-reducer`, and
ran against the first 20 repos from the remote test corpus with NornicDB
`v1.0.43` via the edge-index binary. `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS` was unset; the
runtime logged the default `workers=8`.

Run `pcg-reducer-clean20-20260428T131056Z` drained healthy:

- wall clock from graph start to detected queue drain: `162s`;
- durable queue wall: projector `105.760s`, reducer `137.209s`;
- terminal state: projector `20` succeeded, reducer `158` rows succeeded,
  `pending=0`, `in_flight=0`, `retrying=0`, `dead_letter=0`, `failed=0`;
- reducer executions logged: `177` successes because deployment mapping
  re-executed during the local-authoritative reopen flow;
- reducer queue wait: `p50=5.579s`, `p95=61.525s`, `max=61.549s`;
- reducer handler duration: `p50=0.036s`, `p95=3.048s`, `max=11.979s`.

The slowest handler was
`sql_relationship_materialization/sql:php-large-repo-a`
(`11.979s` handler, `20.328s` queue wait). The largest queue-wait cluster was
deployment mapping at about `61.5s` with sub-second handlers, which points to
phase/readiness waiting rather than handler CPU. The largest source-local
projector item was `php-large-repo-a`: `153,902` facts,
`138,712` content entities, `66.356s` projector duration, and `37.291s`
canonical graph write.

The focused 4-repo proof used the repos that appeared in the 20-repo reducer
hot rows: `php-large-repo-a`, `php-large-repo-c`,
`api-node-communicator`, and `node-service-a`.
Run `pcg-reducer-large4-20260428T131734Z` also drained healthy:

- wall clock from graph start to detected queue drain: `161s`;
- durable queue wall: projector `102.459s`, reducer `130.741s`;
- terminal state: projector `4` succeeded, reducer `32` rows succeeded,
  all failure classes null;
- reducer executions logged: `35` successes, again due deployment mapping
  re-execution;
- reducer queue wait: `p50=3.005s`, `p95=61.598s`, `max=72.458s`;
- reducer handler duration: `p50=0.389s`, `p95=6.759s`, `max=11.504s`.

This makes the 4-repo set a good next proof loop. It reproduces the largest
handler families without waiting for the full 20-repo corpus, and it keeps the
correctness surface broad enough to include service repos, deployment evidence,
SQL relationships, semantic materialization, and workload/deployment mapping.
The next optimization should not start by increasing worker counts. It should
explain why `php-large-repo-a` dominates SQL, semantic,
deployable-unit, workload, and deployment reducers, then prove whether the
primary fix is query shape, backend lookup behavior, or conflict/readiness
routing.

Every fresh performance proof after this point must capture host resource
headroom alongside queue timings: CPU idle, disk I/O idle or utilization,
run wall time, queue wait, handler duration, conflict blocking, and graph
backend query/write timing. Reducer speed work must classify the bottleneck as
Cypher/query shape, graph index or lookup behavior, data shape/write
amplification, conflict routing, or real CPU/disk saturation before changing
worker defaults.

The first resource-headroom proof on the focused 4-repo corpus used commit
`9c0b6207`, rebuilt all runtime binaries, kept `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS` unset, and
captured CPU idle plus disk utilization during the run. Run
`pcg-reducer-large4-resource-baseline-20260428T141520Z` drained healthy:

- wall clock from graph start to detected queue drain: `153s`;
- terminal state: projector `4` succeeded, reducer `32` rows succeeded, with
  `pending=0`, `in_flight=0`, `retrying=0`, `dead_letter=0`, `failed=0`;
- `cpu_idle_avg=80.58%`, `cpu_idle_p50=86.00%`, `cpu_idle_min=22.00%`;
- `disk_util_avg=1.28%`, `disk_util_max=46.72%`, so disk idle never fell below
  about `53%`;
- slowest handler:
  `sql_relationship_materialization/sql:php-large-repo-a`
  (`11.433s` handler, `20.358s` queue wait);
- slowest waits were `deployment_mapping` rows at about `100.9s`, while their
  handlers stayed sub-second.

This evidence rules out host CPU or disk saturation as the primary bottleneck
for the focused corpus. The next useful questions are why eligible work waits,
where shared projection backlog accumulates, and whether graph write/query
shapes are forcing backend-side scans or serialized existence checks.

The first Cypher-shape pilot used commit `55740672`, which writes SQL
relationship rows with concrete source and target entity labels when the
reducer knows them, while preserving broad-label fallback for older queued rows.
Run `pcg-reducer-large4-sql-labelscope-20260428T142359Z` also rebuilt all
runtime binaries and drained healthy:

- wall clock from graph start to detected queue drain: `154s`;
- terminal state: projector `4` succeeded, reducer `32` rows succeeded, with
  `pending=0`, `in_flight=0`, `retrying=0`, `dead_letter=0`, `failed=0`;
- `cpu_idle_avg=80.74%`, `cpu_idle_p50=86.00%`, `cpu_idle_min=22.00%`;
- `disk_util_avg=1.28%`, `disk_util_max=46.00%`, so disk idle never fell below
  about `54%`;
- slowest SQL handler changed from `11.433s` to `11.702s`, and total wall
  changed from `153s` to `154s`.

The label-scoped SQL write shape is more selective and keeps the adapter on a
clear label-property anchor, but this proof did not improve the focused corpus.
That disproves broad SQL labels as the dominant current wall-clock cause for
these repos. The next reducer slice should split shared projection
wait-versus-processing evidence and investigate deployment/readiness routing
before spending more time on SQL label-shape tuning.

Commit `b0c994b6` adds the shared projection wait-versus-processing split for
that next proof. The runner now records selected intent age with
`outcome=processed`, readiness-blocked selected intent age with
`outcome=readiness_blocked`, and graph-write/completion processing duration
after partition selection. It also logs blocked readiness wait, lease-claim
duration, selection duration, and processing duration for completed shared
projection cycles. This does not change claim order, partition count, worker
count, readiness gates, or graph-write behavior.

Run `pcg-reducer-large4-shared-telemetry-20260428T144634Z` used commit
`766fb142`, rebuilt all runtime binaries, kept `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS` unset
(`workers=8`), and reran the same focused 4-repo corpus. It drained healthy:

- wall clock from graph start to detected queue drain: `138s`;
- terminal state: projector `4` succeeded, reducer `32` rows succeeded, with
  `pending=0`, `in_flight=0`, `retrying=0`, `dead_letter=0`, `failed=0`;
- durable source-local projector wall: `102.315s`;
- durable reducer wall by longest domain: `sql_relationship_materialization`
  `130.129s`;
- CPU remained idle-heavy: `cpu_idle_avg=79.25%`, `cpu_idle_p50=85.00%`,
  `cpu_idle_min=24.00%`;
- disk stayed below saturation: `disk_util_avg=9.34%`,
  `disk_util_p50=4.94%`, `disk_util_max=48.00%`.

The largest reducer waits were still reopened `deployment_mapping` rows for the
smaller repos at about `61.29s` queue wait with `0.15s`, `0.16s`, and `1.08s`
handlers. The largest handler remained
`sql_relationship_materialization/sql:php-large-repo-a`
(`11.165s` handler, `19.439s` queue wait). The large PHP repo also produced
the next cluster of `5.6s-6.7s` handlers across code-call, deployable-unit,
inheritance, semantic, deployment, and workload domains.

The important new signal is the shared follow-up lane. The run wrote only
`code_calls` shared projection intents: `3869` total, `3869` completed, with
`119.682s` wall. Code-call projection logs showed repeated readiness-blocked
cycles while canonical nodes for the large PHP repo were not committed, then a
final large cycle wrote `2851` rows in `4.019s`. The smaller repos wrote `244`,
`105`, and `665` rows in `0.187s`, `0.157s`, and `0.719s`. That means the
focused shared follow-up wall was dominated by readiness/polling and the
source-local canonical long pole, not by code-call graph write duration.

This also exposed an observability seam: `code_calls` shared intents are owned
by the dedicated code-call projection runner, not the generic
`SharedProjectionRunner` that commit `b0c994b6` instrumented. The next
observability slice should add the same wait-versus-processing split to the
code-call projection runner before changing code-call worker counts or
partitioning.

Commit `742d0c56` closes that seam for the dedicated code-call projection
runner. The runner now reports selected intent wait, readiness-blocked intent
wait, selection duration, lease-claim duration, and graph-write/completion
processing duration through the same shared projection histograms and structured
cycle logs used by the generic shared projection runner. The change preserves
lease scope, readiness gating, acceptance-unit selection, graph write shape, and
worker defaults. Focused verification:

- `go test ./internal/reducer -run 'TestCodeCallProjectionRunnerProcessesRepoAtomically|TestCodeCallProjectionRunnerProcessOnceReportsReadinessBlockedWait|TestCodeCallProjectionRunnerRecordCycleUsesAcceptanceLogKeys' -count=1`;
- `go test ./internal/reducer ./internal/telemetry -count=1`;
- `go vet ./internal/reducer ./internal/telemetry`;
- `uv run --with mkdocs --with mkdocs-material --with pymdown-extensions mkdocs build --strict --clean --config-file docs/mkdocs.yml`;
- `git diff --check`.

The next runtime proof should rerun the focused 4-repo corpus with commit
`742d0c56` and inspect `domain=code_calls` wait versus processing fields before
changing polling, readiness publication, partitioning, or worker counts.

Run `pcg-reducer-large4-codecall-telemetry-20260428T161400Z` used commit
`e0a407ae` with rebuilt binaries and the same focused 4-repo corpus. It drained
healthy in `141s`, which is effectively no performance improvement over the
prior `138s` run and should be treated as instrumentation evidence rather than
an optimization. Durable state ended at projector `4` succeeded and reducer `32`
succeeded. Host resources remained underused: `cpu_idle_avg=88.45%`,
`cpu_idle_p50=97.00%`, `cpu_idle_min=21.00%`, `disk_util_avg=5.49%`,
`disk_util_p50=4.87%`, and `disk_util_max=44.40%`.

The dedicated code-call telemetry showed `code_calls` shared projection intents
at `3870` total and `3870` completed with `124.162s` table wall. Completed
code-call cycles, however, spent only about `10.85s` in measured processing:
small repos processed `105`, `244`, and `665` rows in `0.142s`, `0.214s`, and
`0.800s`; the large PHP repo processed `2852` rows in `9.696s`. Readiness-blocked
logs fired `25` times with max blocked wait `18.653s`; the largest completed
cycle selected-intent wait was `22.727s`. This confirms the shared lane wall is
mostly not code-call graph-write CPU time. The next optimization proof should
focus on readiness publication/polling and source-local canonical/content
projection timing, while separately keeping an eye on the large PHP code-call
write and SQL handler shapes.

Commit `3e870754` applies the first small readiness-polling optimization from
that evidence. Readiness-blocked code-call cycles now wait the configured base
poll interval instead of being treated like empty cycles that exponentially
back off toward `5s`. On the `e0a407ae` proof this targets the visible tail
where the final PHP code-call cycle started about `4s` after the last blocked
readiness log; it should save seconds per readiness-blocked repo/run, not
hours by itself. The change does not alter readiness gates, acceptance-unit
selection, leases, worker defaults, or graph writes. Verification:

- `go test ./internal/reducer -run 'TestCodeCallProjectionRunnerUsesBasePollIntervalWhileReadinessBlocked|TestCodeCallProjectionRunnerRunContinuesAfterCycleError|TestCodeCallProjectionRunnerProcessOnceReportsReadinessBlockedWait' -count=1`;
- `go test ./internal/reducer ./internal/telemetry -count=1`;
- `go vet ./internal/reducer ./internal/telemetry`.

Run `pcg-reducer-large4-readiness-poll-20260428T163313Z` used commit
`11d74089` with rebuilt binaries and the same focused 4-repo corpus. It drained
healthy in `139s`, which is effectively flat versus the prior `141s` and `138s`
proofs. This confirms the code-call readiness polling change is a tail-latency
cleanup, not the main reducer throughput win. Durable state ended at projector
`4` succeeded and reducer `32` succeeded. Host resources again showed headroom:
`cpu_idle_avg=77.10%`, `cpu_idle_p50=87.00%`, `cpu_idle_min=24.00%`,
`disk_util_avg=9.33%`, `disk_util_p50=4.86%`, and `disk_util_max=44.40%`.

The same run sharpens the next reducer targets. `code_calls` completed `3870`
shared intents with `119.767s` table wall, but measured completed code-call
cycles spent only about `5.12s` in processing for `3866` written rows; the
largest cycle wrote the PHP repo's `2852` rows in `3.98s` processing and
`4.04s` total. Readiness-blocked code-call logs fired more frequently under the
base poll interval (`122` observations, max blocked wait `18.979s`), but wall
time stayed bounded by other reducer dependencies. Reducer handler evidence now
points at `sql_relationship_materialization` (`handler_max=11.325s`,
`queue_wait_max=73.366s`, `handler_sum=13.232s`) and deployment mapping queue
wait (`queue_wait_sum=200.698s` with only `8.530s` handler sum) before any
worker-count change.

Commit `02d9cdc7` applies the same readiness-polling correction to the generic
shared projection runner. Readiness-blocked SQL and inheritance shared
projection partitions now wait the configured base poll interval instead of
being counted as empty cycles that exponentially back off. The change preserves
readiness gates, lease scope, partition count, worker defaults, and graph write
shape; it only keeps known readiness-blocked reducer work responsive. Focused
verification:

- `go test ./internal/reducer -run 'TestSharedProjectionRunnerUsesBasePollIntervalWhileReadinessBlocked|TestSharedProjectionRunnerBackoffOnEmptyCycles|TestSharedProjectionRunnerBackoffResetsOnWork' -count=1`;
- `go test ./internal/reducer ./internal/telemetry -count=1`;
- `go vet ./internal/reducer ./internal/telemetry`;
- `git diff --check`.

Commit `acc50494` narrows the NornicDB local-authoritative projector-drain
claim gate from global to same-scope. Reducer graph writes still wait for
source-local projection for their own `scope_id`, preserving the same-scope
destructive-write correctness gate, but unrelated repos can drain reducer work
while a large repo is still in source-local projection. Focused verification:

Run `pcg-reducer-large4-scope-drain-fresh-20260428T164757Z` used commit
`acc50494` with rebuilt binaries and the same focused 4-repo corpus. It drained
healthy in `140s`, so wall time stayed effectively flat versus the `139s`,
`141s`, and `138s` proofs. The scheduling evidence changed materially,
however: deployment-mapping reducer queue wait dropped from `200.698s` summed
wait in the prior proof to `14.618s`, and SQL relationship reducer queue wait
dropped from `101.708s` to `33.651s`. The run completed with projector `4`
succeeded, reducer `32` succeeded, no failed/dead-letter work, and
`code_calls` shared intents `3870/3870` completed.

The remaining wall-clock long pole is now explicit. Source-local projection
still had `103.328s` durable wall and the largest repo still spent `59.909s`
in `project_generation`, `37.082s` in canonical graph write, and `21.133s` in
content write. Reducer-side SQL handler cost remains the highest handler slice:
`sql_relationship_materialization` had `handler_sum=13.163s` and
`handler_max=11.543s`. Host resources remained underused:
`cpu_idle_avg=79.00%`, `cpu_idle_p50=87.00%`, `cpu_idle_min=26.00%`,
`disk_util_avg=9.51%`, `disk_util_p50=4.85%`, and `disk_util_max=41.20%`.
This proves the scoped gate removes false reducer serialization but is not
enough by itself; the next reducer-owned optimization should split or reshape
the SQL relationship write path and continue conflict-domain analysis for
same-repo final reducers.

Commit `367060fd` scopes grouped SQL relationship retractions by exact source
label and relationship type while preserving the existing broad single-statement
fallback for execute-only callers. This removes the NornicDB-unfriendly grouped
shape `MATCH (source)-[rel:REFERENCES_TABLE|HAS_COLUMN|TRIGGERS]->()` from the
normal reducer grouped path. Focused verification:

Run `pcg-reducer-large4-sql-retract-scope-20260428T170204Z` used commit
`367060fd` with rebuilt binaries and the same focused 4-repo corpus. It drained
healthy in `138s` with projector `4` succeeded, reducer `32` succeeded, no
failed/dead-letter work, and `code_calls` shared intents `3870/3870`
completed. The SQL handler moved only slightly:
`sql_relationship_materialization` had `handler_sum=12.275s` and
`handler_max=10.634s`, versus `13.163s` and `11.543s` in the scoped-drain
proof. SQL reducer queue wait stayed effectively the same (`32.946s` summed
wait versus `33.651s`). Host resources again had headroom:
`cpu_idle_avg=78.90%`, `cpu_idle_p50=86.00%`, `cpu_idle_min=23.00%`,
`disk_util_avg=14.48%`, `disk_util_p50=12.90%`, `disk_util_max=49.80%`, and
`disk_idle_avg=85.52%`.

This proves the scoped SQL retraction shape is safe and marginally cleaner, but
not a meaningful wall-clock reducer fix on this 4-repo proof. The next reducer
slice should either add inner-step SQL handler timing (`ListFacts`, extraction,
retract, write) or shift to the larger measured full-corpus reducer cost:
semantic entity materialization query/write shape.

Commit `afd9fe5f` adds inner-step timing to
`semantic_entity_materialization`: fact loading, extraction, retract decision,
graph write, readiness publication, and total handler duration. Focused

Run `pcg-reducer-large4-semantic-timing-20260428T172941Z` used commit
`afd9fe5f` with rebuilt binaries and the same focused 4-repo corpus. It
drained healthy in `137s` with projector `4` succeeded, reducer `32`
succeeded, no failed/dead-letter work, and `code_calls` shared intents
`3870/3870` completed. Host resources still had headroom:

`disk_util_avg=14.05%`, `disk_util_p50=8.90%`, `disk_util_max=49.00%`, and
`disk_idle_avg=85.95%`.

The semantic split disproved semantic graph write as the focused-corpus hot
path. Across `4` semantic handlers and `184,779` loaded facts, total semantic
handler time was `7.428s`; `load_facts` accounted for `6.998s` of that total,
while graph writes accounted for only `0.256s`. The largest semantic handler
spent `5.610s` loading facts and only `0.170s` writing the graph. The next
semantic optimization should therefore target reducer fact loading/data shape
before Cypher write shape.

The first 20-repo semantic timing run on `afd9fe5f` exposed a reducer
readiness bug instead of producing a valid throughput proof. The durable
reducer queue drained, but `18` `code_calls` shared intents remained pending
across `13` acceptance units because the code-call projection runner waited
for `semantic_nodes_committed` readiness. Those repos had canonical
Function/Class/File nodes from source-local projection but no semantic reducer
item that would ever publish semantic readiness. The run was manually stopped
after evidence extraction with projector `20` succeeded, reducer `160`
succeeded, and `code_calls` shared intents at `3969/3987` complete.

Commit `5242bfce` fixes that correctness and tail-latency issue by gating
`code_calls` shared projection on `canonical_nodes_committed` readiness while
leaving SQL and inheritance shared edge domains gated on
`semantic_nodes_committed`. Focused verification:

`5242bfce` with rebuilt binaries and the same 20-repo corpus. It drained
healthy in `140s`, versus the original clean 20-repo baseline at `162s`.
The isolated contribution of `5242bfce` is correctness/tail elimination rather
than a pure handler-speed win, but this is the first completed 20-repo proof
after the scoped reducer slices. Terminal state was projector `20` succeeded,
reducer `160` succeeded, and shared intents complete:
`code_calls 3987/3987`, `repo_dependency 7/7`.

The `5242bfce` run kept the machine idle-heavy:
`cpu_idle_avg=77.30%`, `cpu_idle_p50=86.00%`, `cpu_idle_min=18.00%`,
`disk_util_avg=9.15%`, `disk_util_p50=4.83%`, `disk_util_max=44.20%`, and
`disk_idle_avg=90.85%`. Reducer handler aggregates still point away from CPU
or disk saturation: `semantic_entity_materialization` handled `7` items with
`handler_sum=7.985s`, `handler_max=5.910s`; `sql_relationship_materialization`
handled `20` items with `handler_sum=13.874s`, `handler_max=11.076s`; and
`workload_materialization` handled `33` items with `handler_sum=12.212s`,
`handler_max=5.785s`.

The 20-repo semantic split matched the focused 4-repo result. Across `7`
semantic handlers and `190,324` loaded facts, semantic handler total was
`7.968s`; fact loading accounted for `7.383s`, extraction `0.148s`, graph
writes `0.402s`, and readiness publication `0.028s`. Code-call shared
projection completed without readiness-blocked observations; `20` completed
cycles wrote `3,967` rows with `7.802s` processing time and `8.072s` total
cycle duration.

write time was not the SQL bottleneck: across `4` SQL handlers and `184,782`

SQL relationship extraction was `0.127s`, retraction was `5.385s`, write-row
shaping was effectively zero, and graph writes were only `0.027s`.

Commit `0bb0fc17` applies the measured SQL optimization: skip SQL relationship
retraction for first-generation attempts when `PriorGenerationCheck` proves the
scope has no previous generation. Retries remain conservative (`attempt_count`
greater than `1` still retracts), and SQL still retracts when a prior generation
exists. Focused verification:

`6.752s` load time across `184,782` facts, with graph writes at `0.036s`.

`repo_dependency 7/7`. SQL handler sum dropped from `13.874s` in the
`5242bfce` 20-repo proof to `7.555s`, SQL handler max dropped from `11.076s`
to `5.477s`, and measured SQL retraction time stayed at `0.000s`. The
remaining SQL cost was again fact loading: `7.376s` load time across `195,020`
facts, while graph writes were only `0.029s`.

Commit `2c0c2b5a` applies the measured fact-loading/data-shape optimization
for reducer domains that already consume only a bounded fact subset. Postgres
`FactStore` now exposes `ListFactsByKind` over the existing
`(scope_id, generation_id, fact_kind, observed_at)` index path, SQL
relationship materialization loads only `content_entity` facts, and semantic
entity materialization loads only `repository` plus `content_entity` facts so
phase publication still has source-run evidence. Focused verification:

`cpu_idle_avg=77.35%`, `io_wait_avg=0.99%`, and `disk_idle_avg=82.74%`.
The wall-clock improvement is real but smaller than the handler improvement,
which means the next throughput work should focus on the remaining large-repo
tail and shared projection/code-call timing rather than assuming SQL or
semantic graph writes are the bottleneck.

Commit `4c2f94d3` tested the narrower conflict-domain hypothesis for
`code_call_materialization`: code-call intent extraction no longer used the
same queue conflict family as semantic, SQL, and inheritance materialization.
The change preserved correctness in local tests and remote runs, but it did not
produce a wall-clock win. Focused run
`pcg-reducer-large4-codecall-conflict-20260428T1842Z` drained healthy in
`127s` versus the filtered-fact 4-repo baseline at `128s`. The large PHP repo's
semantic queue wait dropped from `13.252s` to `7.454s`, and SQL queue wait
dropped from `16.260s` to `11.461s`, but total wall time stayed flat because
overlap shifted work into graph/shared-projection contention instead of
removing it.

Run `pcg-reducer-clean20-codecall-conflict-20260428T18Z` confirmed the same
result on the 20-repo corpus. It drained healthy in `129s`, one second slower
than the filtered-fact 20-repo baseline at `128s`, with projector `20`
succeeded, reducer `160` succeeded, `code_calls 3987/3987`, and
`repo_dependency 7/7`. Code-call handler sum rose slightly from `9.565s` to
`10.050s`; deployable and inheritance handler sums also rose slightly; SQL
handler sum stayed essentially flat (`2.850s` to `2.934s`). CPU and disk still
had headroom: `cpu_idle_avg=77.38%`, `io_wait_avg=1.04%`, and
`disk_idle_avg=82.90%`. Because the measured change did not improve wall time,
commit `d6279147` reverts `4c2f94d3`. Treat this as evidence that simply
loosening safe queue conflict families is not enough; the next reducer slice
should reduce large-repo graph write/data-shape cost or shared projection work,
then retest with the same 4-repo and 20-repo ladder.

Commit `5756f549` adds inner-stage timing for the two late reducer-tail domains:
`workload_materialization` and `deployment_mapping`. Focused run
`pcg-reducer-large4-workload-deploy-timing-20260428T1902Z` drained healthy in
`125s` with projector `4` succeeded, reducer `32` succeeded, and
`code_calls 3870/3870`. The large PHP repo showed the next data-shape target:
`deployment_mapping` spent `5.386s` loading facts and wrote zero infrastructure
rows, while `workload_materialization` spent `5.479s` loading inputs and
produced zero candidates. Graph write time in that final workload handler was
`0.000s`.

Run `pcg-reducer-clean20-workload-deploy-timing-20260428T1905Z` confirmed the
same shape on the 20-repo corpus. It drained healthy in `129s` with projector
`20` succeeded, reducer `160` succeeded, `code_calls 3987/3987`, and
`repo_dependency 8/8`. Workload materialization total was `11.439s`, of which
`9.064s` was input loading and only `0.378s` was graph writing; the largest
workload handler spent `5.726s` loading inputs and produced zero candidates.
Deployment mapping total was `9.265s`, of which `8.939s` was fact loading; it
extracted only `2` infrastructure rows and spent `0.011s` writing
infrastructure graph edges. CPU and disk remained idle-heavy:
`cpu_idle_avg=77.52%`, `io_wait_avg=0.97%`, and `disk_idle_avg=82.84%`.
This is a diagnostic win that points to filtered/narrow input loading for
workload and deployment mapping before graph-write or worker-count changes.

Commit `0fcc13a4` applies that telemetry-backed data-shape fix. Workload
materialization now loads only `repository` and `file` facts, cross-repo
environment enrichment loads only deployment-repo `file` facts, and deployment
mapping infrastructure extraction loads only `repository`, `file`, and legacy
`parsed_file_data` facts. Focused run
`pcg-reducer-large4-workload-deploy-filtered-20260428T1925Z` drained healthy in
`125s` with projector `4` succeeded, reducer `32` succeeded, and
`code_calls 3869/3869`. The final large repo's workload input load dropped from
`5.479s` to `2.892s`; deployment fact load dropped from `5.386s` to `2.780s`.
Wall time stayed flat because the focused run remained dominated by the
source-local long pole and shared code-call tail.

Run `pcg-reducer-clean20-workload-deploy-filtered-20260428T1928Z` validated the
change on the 20-repo corpus. It drained healthy in `127s`, improving from the
workload/deployment timing proof at `129s` and the filtered-fact baseline at
`128s`. Terminal state was projector `20` succeeded, reducer `160` succeeded,
`code_calls 3987/3987`, and `repo_dependency 7/7`. Workload input loading
dropped from `9.064s` to `4.434s`; workload total dropped from `11.439s` to
`7.208s`. Deployment fact loading dropped from `8.939s` to `4.939s`;
deployment total dropped from `9.265s` to `5.441s`. CPU and disk still had
headroom: `cpu_idle_avg=77.39%`, `io_wait_avg=1.23%`, and
`disk_idle_avg=80.57%`. This is a measured handler win with a small 20-repo
wall-clock win, and it reinforces that the remaining reducer work should keep
reducing unnecessary input/backend work before increasing concurrency.

Commit `540fa708` filters the remaining broad reducer input loads where the
handler contract is already fact-kind scoped. `code_call_materialization` and
`deployable_unit_correlation` now load only `repository` and `file` facts;
`inheritance_materialization` now loads only `content_entity` facts. Focused
run `pcg-reducer-large4-remaining-filter-20260428T194911Z` rebuilt binaries
from merge commit `54d1016d` and drained healthy with projector `4` succeeded,
reducer `32` succeeded, and no failures. It drained in `139s`, slower than the
prior focused workload/deployment-filtered proof at `125s`, because the
source-local large-repo long pole varied upward: the largest projector item
spent `65.847s`, including `36.845s` in canonical graph write and `21.015s` in
content write. The changed reducer domains were nevertheless bounded:
`code_call_materialization` handler sum `4.836s`, `deployable_unit_correlation`
handler sum `3.939s`, and `inheritance_materialization` handler sum `2.827s`.
CPU and disk still had headroom: `cpu_idle_avg=88.89%`,
`io_wait_avg=0.33%`, and `disk_idle_avg=93.92%`.

Run `pcg-reducer-clean20-remaining-filter-20260428T195448Z` then validated the
same slice on the 20-repo corpus. It drained healthy in `131s`, versus `127s`
for the previous 20-repo workload/deployment-filtered proof, with projector
`20` succeeded, reducer `160` succeeded, and no failures. This is not a
wall-clock win. The reducer handler work did move in the intended domains:
`code_call_materialization` handler sum dropped from `9.226s` to `5.612s`;
`deployable_unit_correlation` dropped from `8.360s` to `4.606s`; and
`inheritance_materialization` dropped from `7.833s` to `3.116s`. The large
source-local projector again dominated the run at `65.926s`, including
`37.162s` canonical graph write and `21.049s` content write. CPU and disk
remained idle-heavy (`cpu_idle_avg=83.93%`, `io_wait_avg=0.64%`,
`disk_idle_avg=91.68%`). Classify this as a handler/data-shape win only; it
reduces unnecessary reducer input work, but it does not reduce 20-repo wall
time under the current source-local and shared-projection tail.

Commit `29436198` adds shared projection substep telemetry. The existing
`processing_duration_seconds` bucket is now split into
`retract_duration_seconds`, `write_duration_seconds`, and
`mark_completed_duration_seconds` in completed-cycle logs, with the matching
`pcg_dp_shared_projection_step_seconds` histogram labeled by `domain` and
`write_phase`. This is a diagnostic slice only; it does not change reducer
claiming, worker counts, or graph write semantics.

Fresh focused run `pcg-reducer-large4-shared-step-fresh-20260428T201532Z`
rebuilt binaries from commit `29436198` and drained healthy with projector
`4/4`, reducer `32/32`, and no failures. It drained in `122s`. The largest
source-local projector remained the large PHP repo at `148,948` facts with
`59.618s` in `project_generation`. Code-call projection completed all `3,870`
intents. The largest code-call cycle split its `4.085s` processing time into
`2.728s` retract, `1.308s` write, and `0.050s` completion marking. Host
resources stayed idle-heavy: `cpu_idle_avg=81.22%`, `io_wait_avg=0.67%`, and
`disk_idle_avg=90.33%`.

Run `pcg-reducer-clean20-shared-step-20260428T201847Z` then repeated the
proof on the 20-repo corpus. It drained healthy with projector `20/20`,
reducer `158/158`, no open work, and no failures. The durable drain timestamp
was `118s` after run start. Treat the wall-clock improvement from the prior
`131s` run as run variance until repeated because this commit only adds
telemetry. The reducer-domain totals were nevertheless useful:
`workload_materialization` handler sum `9.350s`, `code_call_materialization`
`6.369s`, `deployable_unit_correlation` `5.346s`,
`deployment_mapping` `5.062s`, `semantic_entity_materialization` `4.365s`,
`inheritance_materialization` `3.908s`, and
`sql_relationship_materialization` `3.906s`. Shared intents completed
`code_calls 3987/3987` and `repo_dependency 6/6`. The largest code-call
projection cycle split `4.033s` processing into `2.781s` retract, `1.203s`
write, and `0.049s` completion marking. CPU and disk remained idle-heavy:
`cpu_idle_avg=89.03%`, `io_wait_avg=0.31%`, and `disk_idle_avg=93.90%`.

This evidence points the next reducer optimization at graph mutation shape
inside shared/code-call projection, especially code-call retraction, not
Postgres completion marking and not more generic fact input filtering. The
next proof should either test a correctness-safe first-generation/no-op
code-call retract skip or inspect the exact NornicDB retract Cypher/index path
before changing concurrency defaults.

Commit `2ac5712d` tested the first code-call retract shape cleanup by narrowing
the relationship family selected for each evidence source. `parser/code-calls`
now retracts only `CALLS|REFERENCES`, while `parser/python-metaclass` retracts
only `USES_METACLASS`; unknown evidence sources keep the previous broad
fallback. This preserves the repo/evidence-source correctness fence and does
not change reducer worker counts or queue scheduling.

from commit `2ac5712d` and drained healthy with projector `4/4`, reducer
`32/32`, and no failures. It drained in `126s`, versus `122s` for the prior
shared-step telemetry proof. Code-call projection still completed all `3,870`
intents. The code-call projection aggregate moved only slightly:
`duration_sum 5.324s -> 5.250s`, `retract_sum 3.507s -> 3.545s`,
`write_sum 1.635s -> 1.523s`, and `max_retract 2.728s -> 2.771s`.
CPU and disk remained idle-heavy: `cpu_idle_avg=81.44%`,
`io_wait_avg=1.00%`, and `disk_idle_avg=90.18%`.

Run `pcg-reducer-clean20-narrow-retract-20260428T2045Z` repeated the proof on
the 20-repo corpus. It drained healthy with projector `20/20`, reducer
`160/160`, no open work, and no failures. Wall time was `127s`, versus `118s`
for the prior telemetry-only proof. Code-call projection completed all `3,987`
intents and repo-dependency projection completed `7/7`. Code-call projection
aggregate was effectively flat: `duration_sum 7.896s -> 7.912s`,
`processing_sum 7.702s -> 7.685s`, `retract_sum 5.937s -> 5.775s`,
`write_sum 1.578s -> 1.686s`, `max_retract 2.781s -> 2.794s`, and
`max_write 1.203s -> 1.320s`. Resources again showed headroom:
`cpu_idle_avg=80.22%`, `io_wait_avg=0.78%`, and `disk_idle_avg=90.40%`.

Classify this as a safe query-shape cleanup but a rejected wall-clock
hypothesis. Removing the unrelated relationship type from each evidence-source
retract did not move the dominant `CALLS|REFERENCES` large-repo retract. The
next reducer optimization should inspect or change the actual repo-id anchored
NornicDB retract path, including whether `Function`, `Class`, and `File`
`repo_id` lookups have usable indexes, or prove a first-generation/no-op
code-call retract skip from durable projection state before changing worker
defaults.

Commit `1ea01796` then tested the direct follow-up hypothesis: add NornicDB
`repo_id` lookup indexes for `Function`, `Class`, and `File`, and split
code-call retracts into label-scoped grouped statements so NornicDB could
theoretically enter through concrete label + property anchors instead of the
multi-label `Function|Class|File` shape. Focused run
`pcg-reducer-large4-label-retract-complete-20260428T2122Z` rebuilt binaries
from `1ea01796` and used the corrected proof harness that waits for both fact
work and shared projection intents. It drained healthy with projector `4/4`,
reducer `32/32`, and `code_calls 3870/3870`, but performance regressed:
complete wall was `132s`; code-call projection `duration_sum` rose to
`16.786s`; `retract_sum` rose to `15.100s`; and the largest code-call retract
rose from the prior `~2.77s` band to `12.172s`. CPU and disk remained idle-heavy
(`cpu_idle_avg=80.05%`, `io_wait_avg=0.68%`, `disk_idle_avg=91.56%`), so this
was not a host saturation problem.

Commit `12a0a0a3` reverts `1ea01796`. Classify the label-scoped grouped
retract/index experiment as a rejected throughput hypothesis. The next attempt
should not split code-call retracts into multiple grouped label statements
without a NornicDB-side plan or direct query-profile evidence that proves the
backend can avoid repeating the relationship delete work per label.

Commit `6a6d6c36` applies the durable no-op retract proof for the code-call
shared lane. The runner skips code-call retraction only when all of these are
true:

- the loaded acceptance unit has active rows,
- no stale rows are present for that acceptance unit,
- the intent store can prove there are no previously completed code-call
  intents for the same `scope_id + acceptance_unit_id + projection_domain`.

If the history lookup is unavailable, errors, or finds prior completed work,
the runner keeps the conservative retract-before-write path. This preserves the
retry and generation-change safety rule: a new generation that sees stale rows
still retracts, so partial writes from an earlier uncompleted generation cannot
survive accidentally.

Focused run `pcg-reducer-large4-codecall-skip-20260428T2210Z` rebuilt binaries
from `6a6d6c36` and drained healthy with projector `4/4`, reducer `32/32`,
and `code_calls 3870/3870`. Wall time was `122s`, down from `126s` for the
corrected narrow-retract proof. More importantly, the code-call projection hot
substep moved decisively: `retract_sum 3.545s -> 0.000s`,
`duration_sum 5.250s -> 1.844s`, `processing_sum 5.146s -> 1.744s`, and
`max_duration 4.092s -> 1.415s`. CPU and disk remained idle-heavy:
`cpu_idle_avg=80.44%`, `io_wait_avg=0.56%`, and `disk_idle_avg=89.52%`.

Run `pcg-reducer-clean20-codecall-skip-20260428T2215Z` repeated the proof on
the 20-repo corpus and drained healthy with projector `20/20`, reducer
`160/160`, `code_calls 3987/3987`, `repo_dependency 7/7`, no open work, and no
failures. Wall time was `126s`, roughly flat against the corrected
narrow-retract `127s` proof, but the code-call projection aggregate again
showed the intended reducer-local win: `retract_sum 5.775s -> 0.000s`,
`duration_sum 7.912s -> 2.016s`, `processing_sum 7.685s -> 1.787s`, and
`max_duration 4.223s -> 1.356s`. CPU and disk stayed idle-heavy:
`cpu_idle_avg=80.17%`, `io_wait_avg=0.78%`, and `disk_idle_avg=90.42%`.

Classify this as a measured reducer handler win, not yet a mixed-corpus
wall-clock breakthrough. The first-projection retract was real wasted work and
is now removed safely, but the 20-repo wall still sits around the same
`126-127s` band. That supports a reducer architecture checkpoint: the remaining
large win is probably not another code-call Cypher tweak. The next track should
re-evaluate how source-local completion, reducer-domain ordering, shared-lane
readiness, and graph backend writes interact as a whole while CPU and disk are
idle.

An uncommitted signal-predicate experiment then tested whether workload and
deployment mapping could improve further by asking Postgres for only
repository facts plus file facts with workload, environment, or Terraform
signals. The focused 4-repo run
`pcg-reducer-large4-signal-facts-20260428T2230Z` drained healthy with
projector `4/4`, reducer `32/32`, and `code_calls 3870/3870`, but wall time
regressed slightly from `122s` to `125s`. The specific targeted substeps also
regressed: deployment fact load moved from `3.974s` total / `2.842s` max to
`4.559s` total / `3.254s` max, and workload input load moved from `3.485s`
total / `2.854s` max to `4.025s` total / `3.300s` max. CPU and disk stayed
idle-heavy (`cpu_idle_avg=80.72%`, `io_wait_avg=0.61%`,
`disk_idle_avg=90.71%`). Classify this as a rejected data-shape hypothesis:
JSON/path signal predicates were more expensive than the already-landed
fact-kind filter on this corpus, so no code from that experiment was retained.
Future attempts should use durable signal classifications or indexed summary
tables instead of deeper ad hoc JSON predicates in the hot load path.

Run `pcg-reducer-hot3-semantic-current-20260428T2300Z` then replayed the
three largest semantic long-poles from the original full-corpus reducer log:
`tap-core`, `java-service-b`, and `portal-java-ycm`. It used commit
`53da37e8` with rebuilt binaries and drained healthy with projector `3/3`,
reducer `24/24`, `code_calls 20833/20833`, no open work, and no failures. Wall
time was `192s`. This proof materially changes the full-corpus expectation:
the old run's top semantic handlers were `14323s`, `12107s`, and `10617s`,
while current code reduced those same repos to `1.983s`, `1.760s`, and
`17.968s`. The remaining hot3 time is now mostly source-local and graph-write
shape: `portal-java-ycm` spent `73.916s` in source-local content write,
`33.257s` in canonical graph write, `13.032s` in semantic graph write, and
`11.957s` in code-call shared graph write. CPU and disk remained idle-heavy
(`cpu_idle_avg=90.41%`, `io_wait_avg=0.67%`, `disk_idle_avg=89.12%`). The
next reducer-specific target is no longer broad semantic fact loading; it is
large-batch graph write shape for semantic nodes and code-call edges, while the
overall wall-clock target also needs source-local write scrutiny.

Direct graph inspection confirmed this was not a data-loss speedup. The old
full-corpus graph and the current hot3 graph had matching semantic label counts
for the three repos after mapping each run's repo IDs:

| Repo | Old repo ID | New repo ID | Semantic node counts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tap-core` | `repository:r_6d86b2d4` | `repository:r_02cdc55d` | `Annotation=2749`, `Class=222`, `Enum=43`, `Function=2209`, `Interface=6`, `Variable=1321` |
| `java-service-b` | `repository:r_97fe6172` | `repository:r_f6aad3c1` | `Annotation=2401`, `Class=274`, `Enum=31`, `Function=3266`, `Interface=1`, `Variable=3589` |
| `portal-java-ycm` | `repository:r_c3366057` | `repository:r_aaa31158` | `Annotation=17214`, `Class=3480`, `Component=386`, `Enum=236`, `Function=42116`, `Interface=1354`, `SqlColumn=2601`, `SqlTable=158`, `SqlView=4`, `TypeAlias=59`, `Variable=41802` |

Code-call graph truth also matched for the same repos: old and new runs both
had `289` `CALLS` edges for `tap-core`, `352` for `java-service-b`, and
`19309` for `portal-java-ycm`. This points to an actual reducer performance
bug that had been forcing broad fact loads and expensive no-op/destructive
graph work, not to missing output.

Run `pcg-reducer-hot10-semantic-current-20260428T2315Z` extended that proof to
the ten largest semantic reducers from the original full-corpus timing log:
`tap-core`, `java-service-b`, `portal-java-ycm`, `webapp-monitor-a`,
`php-large-repo-b`, `webapp-provisioning`, `bg-data-pipeline`,
`infra-monitoring-config`, `lib-java-provisioning-entity`, and
`webapp-react-trident`. It used commit `33e952c4` with rebuilt binaries and
drained healthy with projector `10/10`, reducer `80/80`,
`code_calls 54075/54075`, no open work, and no failures. Wall time was
`210s`. The original full-corpus run spent about `64648s` of semantic handler
worker-time on these ten repositories. Current code spent `41.037s` total, with
`20.818s` max. CPU and disk still had substantial idle headroom:
`cpu_idle_avg=71.93%`, `io_wait_avg=1.63%`, and `disk_idle_avg=83.81%`.

The hot10 run confirmed that the old semantic tail was a real reducer waste
path, not a graph-truth regression. Direct graph inspection matched semantic
label counts exactly for every repo after mapping old and new repo IDs:

| Repo | Old repo ID | New repo ID | Direct graph truth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tap-core` | `repository:r_6d86b2d4` | `repository:r_f872800e` | All semantic label counts matched, including `Annotation=2749`, `Function=2209`, `Variable=1321` |
| `java-service-b` | `repository:r_97fe6172` | `repository:r_b4bd1743` | All semantic label counts matched, including `Annotation=2401`, `Function=3266`, `Variable=3589` |
| `portal-java-ycm` | `repository:r_c3366057` | `repository:r_a5aeac9b` | All semantic label counts matched, including `Annotation=17214`, `Function=42116`, `Variable=41802` |
| `webapp-monitor-a` | `repository:r_5e25cd26` | `repository:r_2a1c9f38` | All semantic label counts matched, including `Annotation=1611`, `Function=5844`, `Variable=5999` |
| `php-large-repo-b` | `repository:r_8c004fa2` | `repository:r_e816713b` | All semantic label counts matched, including `Directory=1822`, `Function=28926`, `Variable=131977` |
| `webapp-provisioning` | `repository:r_c1cfbb5a` | `repository:r_d4dc6a0f` | All semantic label counts matched, including `Annotation=761`, `Function=1262`, `Variable=1826` |
| `bg-data-pipeline` | `repository:r_4f5ff046` | `repository:r_1bed0620` | All semantic label counts matched, including `SqlColumn=1289`, `Function=1918`, `Variable=6136` |
| `infra-monitoring-config` | `repository:r_96238560` | `repository:r_8854f8cf` | All semantic label counts matched, including `File=1724`, `Function=2683`, `Variable=10181` |
| `lib-java-provisioning-entity` | `repository:r_2099f106` | `repository:r_ee2cd439` | All semantic label counts matched, including `Annotation=573`, `Function=677`, `Variable=401` |
| `webapp-react-trident` | `repository:r_19da898d` | `repository:r_78bce920` | All semantic label counts matched, including `Component=107`, `Function=1341`, `Variable=7723` |

The remaining hot10 wall time was no longer semantic handler execution.
`portal-java-ycm` spent `74.743s` in source-local content write, `44.585s` in
canonical graph write, and `15.873s` in semantic graph write. `php-large-repo-b`
spent `51.888s` in source-local content write and `56.870s` in canonical graph
write, while its semantic handler completed in `4.372s`. The largest code-call
shared-projection cycles were `14.999s` and `15.953s`; both had
`retract_duration_seconds=0`, so the current code-call tail is write-side work,
not the previously removed first-projection retract. The next proof should
therefore focus on large-batch graph write shape and readiness granularity, not
more semantic fact-load micro-tuning.

Run `pcg-reducer-hot20-mixed-current-20260428T222132Z` then combined the hot10
set with ten smaller/mixed service, PHP, Ansible, Helm, ArgoCD, and Terraform
repositories. It used commit `f52e03a4` with rebuilt binaries and drained
healthy with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 57987/57987`,
`repo_dependency 3/3`, no open work, and no failures. Wall time was `305s`.
This run clarified the reducer scheduling model: reducer work is pipelined by
repo generation and readiness gate, not held for a single global end-of-corpus
wave. During the run, reducers drained the first `115` domain items while
several source-local projectors were still active; the final reducer items
became claimable only after the last large source-local projection published
readiness.

The hot20 reducer domain summary was:

| Domain | Items | Handler sum | Handler max | Queue wait sum | Queue wait max |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `semantic_entity_materialization` | 15 | `44.779s` | `18.296s` | `59.698s` | `10.501s` |
| `code_call_materialization` | 20 | `15.312s` | `4.087s` | `12.254s` | `0.985s` |
| `sql_relationship_materialization` | 20 | `14.889s` | `5.904s` | `127.552s` | `29.536s` |
| `inheritance_materialization` | 20 | `14.206s` | `5.105s` | `43.042s` | `5.030s` |
| `workload_materialization` | 25 | `11.008s` | `2.916s` | `83.464s` | `8.039s` |
| `deployable_unit_correlation` | 20 | `10.015s` | `3.383s` | `12.395s` | `0.985s` |
| `deployment_mapping` | 20 | `8.240s` | `2.897s` | `1363.132s` | `98.522s` |
| `workload_identity` | 20 | `1.662s` | `0.122s` | `61.854s` | `7.035s` |

The queue-wait numbers are not proof that more reducer workers would help:
most of the largest waits were readiness waits behind active source-local
projection, not CPU-bound reducer execution. The long source-local projections
were `php-large-repo-b` at `177.800s`, `portal-java-ycm` at `129.435s`,
`php-large-repo-c` at `94.499s`, `webapp-monitor-a` at `81.554s`,
and `php-large-repo-a` at `73.353s`. CPU and disk were still not
saturated on average: `cpu_idle_avg=72.23%`, `io_wait_avg=1.72%`, and
`disk_idle_avg=85.38%`.

The hot20 code-call shared projection tail also stayed write-side. The two
largest cycles wrote `24583` and `20189` rows in `20.331s` and `13.654s`; both
had `retract_duration_seconds=0`, while graph write took `19.272s` and
`12.607s`. This confirms that first-projection retract skipping removed the
old destructive no-op cost, and that the next reducer-specific work should
measure and reshape large code-call `CALLS` writes rather than re-opening the
retract path.

The first code-call write-shape experiment then tested
`PCG_CODE_CALL_EDGE_BATCH_SIZE` without changing reducer worker count or
correctness gates. The isolated `php-large-repo-b` proof at the previous
default `50` drained healthy in `188s`; its code-call cycle wrote `24584`
intents in `15.653s`, with `14.652s` spent in graph write. Batch-size overrides
kept the same truth volume and showed a clear but flattening curve:

| Run | Batch size | Wall | Code-call cycle | Graph write | CPU idle | Disk idle |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `pcg-reducer-websites-codecall-batch50-20260428T223222Z` | 50 | `188s` | `15.653s` | `14.652s` | `81.56%` | `91.08%` |
| `pcg-reducer-websites-codecall-batch200-20260428T223542Z` | 200 | `186s` | `13.128s` | `12.105s` | `81.44%` | `91.17%` |
| `pcg-reducer-websites-codecall-batch500-20260428T223859Z` | 500 | `184s` | `11.813s` | `10.745s` | `80.65%` | `90.97%` |
| `pcg-reducer-websites-codecall-batch1000-20260428T224215Z` | 1000 | `183s` | `11.328s` | `10.304s` | `81.38%` | `91.59%` |

The small-repo sanity check
`pcg-reducer-tapcore-codecall-batch1000-20260428T224539Z` also drained healthy
in `17s` with `code_calls 290/290` and a `0.064s` code-call cycle. The matched
hot20 proof `pcg-reducer-hot20-codecall-batch1000-20260428T224610Z` then
drained healthy with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`,
`code_calls 57987/57987`, `repo_dependency 3/3`, no open work, and no failures.
Wall moved from `305s` to `297s`. The two largest code-call cycles moved from
`20.331s`/`13.654s` to `15.211s`/`9.067s`, while their graph-write substeps
moved from `19.272s`/`12.607s` to `14.181s`/`8.089s`. Commit `b085803c`
therefore raises the default code-call edge batch size from `50` to `1000`.
Classify this as a measured reducer graph-write win with modest wall-clock
improvement; it does not change worker defaults, queue semantics, readiness
gates, or graph truth rules.

The follow-up source-local canonical write pass intentionally stopped at an
evidence boundary rather than continuing to tune per repo. Focused run
`pcg-reducer-websites-canonical-phase-20260428T2303Z` on
`php-large-repo-b` used commit `ead46ef4` with rebuilt binaries and drained
healthy in `184s`: projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, `code_calls 24584/24584`,
`cpu_idle_avg=80.62%`, and `disk_idle_avg=91.50%`. Existing telemetry was
enough to attribute the source-local long pole: content write took `43.695s`
(`upsert_entities=31.833s`, `upsert_files=11.507s`), canonical write took
`43.544s`, and canonical `entities` accounted for `39.189s` of that graph
write. Inside the entity phase, `Variable` dominated with `131,977` rows and
`31.738s`, while `Function` contributed `28,926` rows and `7.390s`.

Two experiments then bounded the obvious tuning space. Enabling the patched
cross-file containment path with
`PCG_NORNICDB_BATCHED_ENTITY_CONTAINMENT=true` regressed the same repo:
`pcg-reducer-websites-batched-containment-20260428T2310Z` drained healthy but
wall rose to `264s`, canonical write rose to `124.322s`, canonical entities
rose to `119.985s`, and `Variable` alone rose to `106.832s`. Widening
NornicDB entity phase-group caps without changing row shape helped only
slightly: `Function=20,Variable=20` moved the isolated repo to `180s`,
canonical write to `39.167s`, canonical entities to `34.780s`, and
`Variable` to `29.427s`. The matched hot20 proof
`pcg-reducer-hot20-entity-phase20-20260428T2334Z` drained healthy with
projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 57987/57987`,
`repo_dependency 3/3`, `cpu_idle_avg=70.29%`, and `disk_idle_avg=88.20%`.
Wall moved from the prior hot20 code-call batch proof at `297s` to `292s`.
This is a small source-local graph-write improvement, not the architectural
win needed for the full corpus.

Commit `6602cec1` tested explicit projector repo-size scheduling by persisting
source-local `fact_count` on projector work items and adding a guarded
`PCG_PROJECTOR_CLAIM_ORDER=size_desc` claim order. The hypothesis was that
claiming larger source-local generations first would prevent one giant repo
from becoming the final reducer-readiness tail. Same-commit A/B proofs rejected
that hypothesis: focused 4-repo FIFO drained in `125s`, while size-desc drained
in `128s`; hot20 FIFO and hot20 size-desc both drained in `301s`. Both hot20
runs completed projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 57987/57987`,
and `repo_dependency 3/3`, with CPU and disk still idle-heavy. Commit
`22f37cb7` reverts the knob so the PR does not carry a public scheduler setting
that failed to move throughput.

The size-tier rejection left code-call shared write time as the next measured
reducer-local signal. The hot20 FIFO control had `code_calls` write sum
`28.413s`, including two large write cycles around `14.412s` and `8.088s`.
Testing `PCG_CODE_CALL_EDGE_BATCH_SIZE=2000` without changing defaults also
rejected simple batch widening:
`pcg-reducer-websites-codecall-batch2000-20260429T0010Z` drained healthy, but
wall was `186s` and the single code-call cycle took `12.667s` with `11.589s`
in write time, worse than the prior batch-1000 single-large proof. The next
code-call optimization needs query/backend shape changes, not more rows per
grouped statement.

Commit `519dd6a9` tested the first PCG-side code-call query-shape candidate:
carry parser-owned `Function`/`Class` labels into code-call shared intent
payloads and route writes to exact source/target label Cypher when both labels
are known, while retaining the broad `Function|Class|File` fallback for old or
incomplete rows. The single-large proof
`pcg-reducer-websites-codecall-labels-20260429T0105Z` rebuilt binaries from
that commit and drained healthy with projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, and
`code_calls 24584/24584`. It did not improve throughput: wall was `184s`
versus the prior batch-1000 single-large proof at `183s`, and the code-call
cycle write substep moved from `10.304s` to `10.660s`. CPU and disk remained
idle-heavy (`cpu_idle_avg=80.42%`, `io_wait_avg=0.46%`,
`disk_idle_avg=90.90%`). Commit `b0b88a44` reverts the slice. Classify this
as a rejected PCG-side label-routing hypothesis; the next code-call write
optimization needs NornicDB relationship-MERGE/set-property hot-path evidence
or a durable delta/write-state design, not more PCG label splitting.

Commit `87646e1b` tested whether publishing reducer intents immediately after
the canonical graph write, before normal content-store writes, would overlap
downstream reducer/shared work with source-local content persistence. The
single-large proof `pcg-reducer-websites-intent-before-content-20260429T0043Z`
rebuilt binaries and drained healthy with projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, and
`code_calls 24584/24584`, but wall stayed flat at `183s`; the code-call cycle
was `11.510s` with `10.454s` in write time, and resources remained idle-heavy
(`cpu_idle_avg=80.00%`, `io_wait_avg=0.62%`, `disk_idle_avg=91.43%`). The small
sanity proof `pcg-reducer-small-intent-before-content-20260429T0047Z` drained
healthy in `13s`. The mixed proof
`pcg-reducer-hot20-intent-before-content-87646e1b-20260429T0048Z` then drained
healthy with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 57987/57987`,
and `repo_dependency 3/3`, but regressed from the current-head hot20 baseline
at `298s` to `305s`; CPU and disk still had headroom (`cpu_idle_avg=70.88%`,
`io_wait_avg=1.74%`, `disk_idle_avg=84.75%`). Commit `ef856c18` reverts the
slice. Classify this as a rejected readiness/ordering overlap hypothesis:
content-write ordering was not the measured wall-clock blocker on this ladder.

The no-code runtime probe
`pcg-reducer-websites-codecall-group4-20260429T0058Z` tested
`PCG_CODE_CALL_EDGE_GROUP_BATCH_SIZE=4` on the same single-large repo after
reverting the ordering experiment. It drained healthy with projector `1/1`,
reducer `8/8`, and `code_calls 24584/24584`, but regressed to `191s`; the
code-call cycle was `17.782s` with `16.725s` in write time. Host resources
remained idle-heavy (`cpu_idle_avg=80.44%`, `io_wait_avg=0.56%`,
`disk_idle_avg=91.93%`). Classify this as a rejected grouped-transaction
hypothesis; the code-call path should not widen grouped statement transactions
without NornicDB-side evidence.

NornicDB runtime-branch commit `9369a40` then adds that backend-side evidence. A focused
regression test proves the exact PCG code-call shape
`UNWIND ... MATCH (source:Function {uid: row.caller_entity_id}) MATCH
(target:Function {uid: row.callee_entity_id}) MERGE
(source)-[rel:CALLS]->(target) SET rel...` previously executed successfully
but missed the generalized batch-chain hot path. The patch routes no-return
`UNWIND MATCH ... MERGE` mutation chains through the batch executor and
preserves relationship `SET` properties for created and matched edges. Local
microbench evidence on a 512-row code-call batch moved from the fallback path's
`2260916375 ns/op` to the patched batch path's `1386075 ns/op` on the same
machine. This re-opens the exact-label PCG code-call routing that commit
`b0b88a44` reverted, but only paired with the NornicDB hot-path fix that was
missing in the first proof.

PCG commit `7508eecc` briefly restored exact-label code-call routing and
remote-pulled NornicDB commit `9369a40` to test the combined hypothesis. The
single-large proof `pcg-reducer-websites-label-hotpath-20260429T0140Z`
rebuilt binaries and drained healthy with projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, and
`code_calls 24584/24584`, but regressed to `193s`; the code-call projection
cycle was `16.756s` with `15.648s` in graph write time. Host resources still
had headroom (`cpu_idle_avg=81.54%`, `io_wait_avg=0.57%`,
`disk_idle_avg=92.57%`). The small sanity proof
`pcg-reducer-small-label-hotpath-20260429T0145Z` drained healthy in `14s` with
`code_calls 32/32`. Classify the combined PCG exact-label routing as a rejected
runtime hypothesis for this PR; keep the NornicDB regression/benchmark as
backend evidence, but do not keep the PCG routing until a narrower data-shape
or statement-count proof explains the large-repo regression.

Commit `88f2684f` adds that missing proof surface without changing reducer
behavior: every shared edge write now logs the execution mode, input rows,
written rows, skipped rows, route count, statement count, batch size, group
batch size, and duration. This is classified as a diagnostic win. The next
single-large proof should use those log lines to compare broad code-call
routing, exact-label routing, and NornicDB's backend hot path before another
Cypher/data-shape change is retained.

The first runtime proof with that telemetry,
`pcg-reducer-websites-write-shape-20260429T0156Z` at PCG commit `97a2ff61`,
rebuilt binaries and drained `php-large-repo-b` in `188s` with projector
`1/1`, reducer `8/8`, and `code_calls 24584/24584`. The code-call projection
cycle took `16.810s`, with `15.770s` in graph write time. Shape logs showed
one route, zero skipped rows, `25` grouped writes, `24,583` written rows, and
`15.730s` summed group duration. Full 1,000-row batch duration rose from
`0.369s` at the start to about `0.84s` near the end while CPU and disk still
had headroom (`cpu_idle_avg=80.48%`, `io_wait_avg=0.56%`,
`disk_idle_avg=91.53%`). This rules out route fragmentation as the current
large code-call bottleneck and points to NornicDB relationship-write cost
growing as `CALLS` edges accumulate.

NornicDB runtime-branch commit `824c990` targets that backend cost directly:
the no-return `UNWIND MATCH MATCH MERGE rel SET rel...` chain-batch executor
now stages newly-created relationships and flushes them with `BulkCreateEdges`
once per batch, while preserving same-batch duplicate-row `MERGE` semantics and
the previous per-edge retry fallback for edge-ID collisions. Focused tests cover
the PCG hot-path trace and duplicate pending relationship handling. The local
Badger accumulating benchmark for five 1,000-row code-call batches moved from
`657270417 ns/op` to `595086583 ns/op`.

The remote proof `pcg-reducer-websites-bulk-rel-20260429T021749Z` rebuilt
NornicDB commit `824c990` and PCG commit `521565f1`, then drained the same
`php-large-repo-b` repo healthy with projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, and
`code_calls 24584/24584`. Wall time stayed `188s`, but the code-call graph write
fell from `15.770s` to `14.247s`, and summed edge batch duration fell from
`15.730s` to `14.209s` across the same `25` batches and `24,583` rows. Batch
durations ranged from `0.355s` to `0.760s`. Host headroom remained high
(`cpu_idle_avg=80.52%`, `io_wait_avg=0.63%`, `disk_idle_avg=91.67%`). Classify
this as a backend handler win, not a wall-clock win on the isolated large-repo
proof; it confirms relationship create transaction overhead was real but not
the only remaining long pole.

NornicDB commit `7017ee2` tested the next backend hypothesis: once the
edge-between index is marked ready, a typed exact-index miss should be
authoritative and should not fall back to scanning the source node's legacy
outgoing fanout. A focused storage benchmark with a 5,000-edge source fanout
showed the ready-index miss path at `1880 ns/op` versus the legacy-scan miss
path at `6063200 ns/op` with `7322494 B/op`. However, the remote PCG proof
`pcg-reducer-websites-ready-miss-20260429T023832Z` rebuilt NornicDB `7017ee2`
and PCG `d86678b1`, then drained the same large repo in `188s` with projector
`1/1`, reducer `8/8`, and `code_calls 24584/24584`. Code-call graph write was
`14.320s` and summed edge batch duration was `14.260s`, effectively flat versus
the prior `824c990` proof (`14.247s` write, `14.209s` summed batches). Host
headroom remained high (`cpu_idle_avg=81.81%`, `io_wait_avg=0.59%`,
`disk_idle_avg=91.64%`). Classify this as a valid backend micro-optimization
but a rejected PCG throughput hypothesis for this corpus slice.

PCG commit `972a7202` retested exact-label code-call write routing after the
newer NornicDB backend commits `824c990` and `7017ee2`, because the prior
PCG-side exact-label rejection had run against an older backend shape. The
remote proof `pcg-reducer-websites-label-retry-20260429T000000Z` rebuilt PCG
`972a7202` and used NornicDB `7017ee2`. It drained the same large repo healthy
with projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, and `code_calls 24584/24584`, but
regressed wall time from the current broad-label baseline `188s` to `200s`.
The code-call cycle write time regressed from `14.320s` to `15.328s`, and
summed edge batches regressed from `14.260s` to `15.259s` across the same `25`
batches and `24,583` rows. Host headroom stayed high
(`cpu_idle_avg=82.52%`, `io_wait_avg=0.55%`, `disk_idle_avg=92.16%`). Commit
`1f8dbe45` reverts `972a7202`. Classify this as a confirmed rejected PCG-side
label-routing hypothesis even after the latest NornicDB relationship-write
fixes.

NornicDB commit `2dd6d27` adds opt-in `NORNICDB_PCG_CHAIN_PROFILE=1`
diagnostics for the PCG-style no-return `UNWIND MATCH MATCH MERGE rel SET ...`
chain-batch path. The profile emits one compact line per batch with input rows,
processed rows, node lookup time, relationship lookup time, edge update time,
and bulk relationship-create time. The normal disabled path remained inside the
existing benchmark noise band:
`BenchmarkUnwindMatchMergeRelationshipSet_CodeCallShapeBadgerAccumulating`
reported `595426043 ns/op` after the profiling patch, comparable to the prior
`595086583 ns/op` proof for `824c990`. Focused verification passed with
`go test -tags 'noui nolocalllm' ./pkg/cypher -run
'TestUnwindMatchMergeRelationshipSet_(ProfilesChainBatchWhenEnabled|UsesChainBatchHotPath|BulkPathDeduplicatesPendingRelationships)'
-count=1`, and `go test -tags 'noui nolocalllm' ./pkg/cypher -count=1`.

Remote run `pcg-reducer-websites-chain-profile-20260429T0315Z` rebuilt PCG
`487b683c`, rebuilt NornicDB `2dd6d27`, enabled
`NORNICDB_PCG_CHAIN_PROFILE=1`, and drained `php-large-repo-b` healthy:
projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, and `code_calls 24584/24584`. Wall time stayed
at the current `188s` baseline; code-call graph write was `14.367s`, and summed
edge batch duration was `14.328s`. The NornicDB profile split for the 26
code-call-shaped batches was `7.271s` total inside the chain path, with
`4.475s` in relationship existence lookups, `1.190s` in node lookups, and
`1.286s` in bulk edge create. Every relationship lookup was a miss
(`24584/24584` misses), so the reducer was paying a growing miss cost before
creating fresh edges. Host headroom stayed high (`cpu_idle_avg=81.00%`,
`io_wait_avg=0.56%`, `disk_idle_avg=91.62%`).

Three follow-up NornicDB slices were tested against the same PCG commit
`487b683c` and same large repo. NornicDB `fdaf7a1` preserved the edge-between
head invariant and trusted ready-index typed misses, but
`pcg-reducer-websites-edge-miss-20260429T0825Z` regressed to `198s`; code-call
write was `15.424s` and relationship lookup still totaled `4.869s`, proving the
PCG path was bypassing that storage method. NornicDB `71c62ad` routed
`AsyncEngine.GetEdgeBetween` through the typed lookup while preserving pending
write/delete semantics, but `pcg-reducer-websites-async-edge-20260429T0841Z`
still stayed in noise (`193s`, code-call write `14.918s`, relationship lookup
`4.685s`), proving the active Cypher path was still inside the transaction
wrapper. NornicDB `07b792b` then routed `BadgerTransaction.GetEdgeBetween`
through the typed lookup. The proof
`pcg-reducer-websites-tx-edge-20260429T0851Z` drained healthy in `184s`, with
code-call graph write down to `10.064s` and summed edge batch duration
`10.025s`. The backend profile confirmed the actual win: chain-path total fell
from `7.271s` to `2.807s`, and relationship lookup fell from `4.475s` to
`0.162s` while preserving `24584/24584` relationship misses and exact code-call
completion. CPU and disk remained idle-heavy (`cpu_idle_avg=80.73%`,
`io_wait_avg=0.62%`, `disk_idle_avg=91.52%`), so the next proof must validate
this handler win across two to four large repos before another full-corpus run.

The 4-large-repo confirmation proof
`pcg-reducer-large4-tx-edge-20260429T0900Z` reused PCG `487b683c`, NornicDB
`07b792b`, and the focused large set `php-large-repo-b`,
`portal-java-ycm`, `webapp-provisioning`, and `bg-data-pipeline`. It drained
healthy with projector `4/4`, reducer `32/32`, and `code_calls 47016/47016`.
Wall time was `211s`. The four code-call projection cycles completed at
`0.126s`, `0.450s`, `13.435s`, and `10.555s`, with write substeps `0.096s`,
`0.356s`, `12.382s`, and `9.479s`. Reducer handler sums showed the next tails
more clearly: semantic materialization `27.218s`, inheritance `8.774s`, SQL
relationships `8.725s`, and code calls `7.828s`; deployment mapping remained
mostly queue wait (`122.167s` wait sum versus `3.130s` handler sum). Host
headroom was still high (`cpu_idle_avg=74.40%`, `io_wait_avg=1.20%`,
`disk_idle_avg=86.47%`). This confirms the transactional lookup change is
correct on multiple large repos, but the next proof should be the 20-repo corpus
before claiming a full-corpus wall-clock reduction.

The hot20 rerun `pcg-reducer-hot20-tx-edge-20260429T0910Z` used the same 20
repos as the earlier hot20 proofs and drained healthy with projector `20/20`,
reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 57987/57987`, and `repo_dependency 3/3`. Wall
time was `307s`, worse than the earlier `297s` batch-1000 proof and roughly
flat with the `305s` mixed proof, so the transaction-layer lookup fix is not a
hot20 wall-clock win. The largest code-call cycles were `9.813s` and `14.860s`
with write substeps `8.727s` and `13.744s`; code-call handler sum was
`15.609s`. The remaining mixed-corpus tail shifted back to queue/readiness and
other domains: deployment mapping wait sum `1368.457s`, semantic handler sum
`44.532s`, SQL handler sum `14.705s`, and inheritance handler sum `14.671s`.
Host headroom remained idle-heavy (`cpu_idle_avg=69.77%`, `io_wait_avg=1.73%`,
`disk_idle_avg=84.75%`). Classify `07b792b` as a backend handler win that
should be kept for NornicDB, but not as the reducer wall-clock breakthrough for
the 20-repo corpus.

The next same-commit hot20 proof tested the source-local long-pole hypothesis
without changing reducer worker defaults. Run
`pcg-reducer-hot20-largegen4-20260429T094208Z` reused PCG `487b683c`,
NornicDB `07b792b`, and the same 20 repositories, but set
`PCG_LARGE_GEN_MAX_CONCURRENT=4` instead of the default `2`. It drained healthy
with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 57987/57987`, and
`repo_dependency 3/3`. Wall time dropped from `307s` to `240s` (`21.8%`
faster). CPU idle fell from `69.77%` to `62.91%`; IO wait stayed low
(`2.06%`), and disk remained mostly idle (`disk_idle_avg=82.07%`), so the
change used more available host headroom without saturating storage. The proof
also explains the win: in the prior hot20 run the final large projector record
included about `80s` waiting for the large-generation semaphore before
`load_facts`; with concurrency `4`, every large-generation semaphore acquisition
was effectively immediate. The remaining source-local tail is now sequential
per-repo work, not semaphore wait: the largest projector stages were
`content_write=77.416s` plus `canonical_write=47.482s` for one
`109410`-entity repo, and `content_write=50.759s` plus
`canonical_write=58.987s` for one `160909`-entity repo. Classify this as a real
20-repo wall-clock win and a scheduling/admission win, while keeping the next
step evidence-first: do not raise global reducer workers from this result; use
the same proof ladder to decide whether `4` is the safe local-authoritative
large-generation default and whether content/canonical source-local writes can
be made less sequential without weakening reducer readiness gates.

Follow-up code promoted this measured value only for the
`local_authoritative` profile: when `PCG_LARGE_GEN_MAX_CONCURRENT` is unset,
the projector now defaults to `4` for local-authoritative runs and keeps `2` for
other profiles. Explicit environment overrides still win. This is intentionally
an admission/scheduling default, not a reducer-worker default change.

The default-behavior confirmation run
`pcg-reducer-hot20-largegen4-default-20260429T095334Z` used PCG `7cf56491`
with no `PCG_LARGE_GEN_MAX_CONCURRENT` override. It drained healthy in `239s`
with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 57986/57986`, and
`repo_dependency 3/3`. CPU idle was `62.50%`, IO wait was `2.12%`, and disk idle
was `82.52%`. Large-generation semaphore acquisition again happened
immediately, confirming the promoted default is active. The one-row code-call
total difference versus the previous `57987/57987` env proof is recorded as a
residual comparison note, not as a reducer failure: all produced intents
completed, there were no failed/dead-letter work items, and this slice changed
only admission defaults.

### Architecture Checkpoint

The evidence now separates three classes of work:

1. **Harvested handler waste.** SQL first-generation retracts, broad fact
   loads, and code-call first-projection retracts were measurable waste and
   have been reduced.
2. **Rejected micro-optimizations.** Code-call conflict splitting,
   label-scoped grouped code-call retractions, size-desc projector scheduling,
   and batch-2000 code-call writes did not move throughput; several regressed.
3. **Remaining architecture bottleneck.** CPU and disk remain idle while wall
   time is governed by source-local long poles, shared projection completion,
   and graph backend operations that do not saturate the host.

The next reducer design pass should therefore stop chasing global per-label
batch caps and answer bigger questions:

- Can destructive repo-wide graph rewrites become durable deltas for code,
  inheritance, and SQL edges?
- Can source-local projection publish smaller readiness units earlier, so
  reducers do not wait behind a full-repo long pole?
- Should reducer/projector scheduling use explicit repo-size tiers so small
  and medium repos drain around giant high-cardinality repos instead of sharing
  one effective tail?
- Can shared projection lanes be partitioned by true acceptance unit only after
  destructive overlaps are removed?
- Does NornicDB need a direct relationship-delete / relationship-existence
  hot path for PCG's `(source)-[TYPE]->(target)` edge families?
- Which domains still do work after their graph writes are no-ops, and can that
  be proven from durable state rather than inferred from timing?

### Change Impact Ledger

Classify every reducer-throughput slice by the metric it was meant to move.
This avoids treating a correctness or observability improvement as a throughput
win when wall-clock evidence does not support that claim.

Focused TDD covered WordPress core dirs, `.min.mjs`, and JWPlayer/Prototype/reveal signatures. `pcg-reducer-api-wordpress-runtime-0a8-20260429T1405Z` drained API/PHP in `107s` with projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, `code_calls 2253/2253`, content entities `120077`, canonical entity phase `28.041s`, `Variable` `103908` rows in `22.549s`, CPU idle `81.07%`, and disk idle `91.07%`. `pcg-reducer-large4-wpcore-runtime-0a8-20260429T1410Z` improved the same four-large slice from `154s` to `141s`, with projector `4/4`, reducer `32/32`, `code_calls 29937/29937`, CPU idle `62.40%`, IO wait `2.25%`, and disk idle `81.24%`; API/PHP projected entities fell to `119398`, and portal/Java projected entities fell to `106470`. `pcg-reducer-hot20-wpcore-runtime-0a8-20260429T1415Z` improved hot20 from `165s` to `153s`, with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 36832/36832`, `repo_dependency 3/3`, CPU idle `54.23%`, IO wait `2.55%`, and disk idle `76.57%`. | Modest real wall-clock data-shape win; not a breakthrough. Remaining large-corpus target is canonical entity write-path efficiency and the large code-call shared projection cycle |

The ledger now points past SQL/semantic fact loading as the only easy handler
win. SQL and semantic graph writes are both small on the focused and 20-repo
proofs. Canonical entity cap tuning yields only seconds. The new hot20
large-generation proof shows a real source-local admission win, but the
remaining wall-clock tail is now dominated by per-repo `content_write` plus
`canonical_write` sequencing and shared projection/code-call timing around
those repos, while CPU and disk still have headroom. Increasing the existing
content-entity batch knob is not a material lever: the same 160,909-entity repo
spent essentially the same time in content persistence at 41 batches as at 537
batches, so the next source-local work should target data shape, indexing,
delta semantics, or readiness boundaries rather than wider `INSERT` statements.
Deferring local-authoritative content trigram index maintenance is the first
large source-local content-write win on the hot20 ladder (`239s` to `205s`
after fixing the early-restore race), but the restored hot20 tail is now
canonical graph write and large shared code-call writes rather than reducer
fact loading or content batch count.

The browser-library pruning proof is the first large post-deferral data-shape
win. It reduces rows before they reach both Postgres content storage and
NornicDB canonical writes, so it saves time in multiple phases instead of
only shaving a single query. The 4-large proof still leaves API/PHP and
portal/Java canonical writes as hot paths, so the next proof should run the
20-repo ladder and then decide whether remaining work is more repo-shape
classification or NornicDB canonical entity write-path tuning.

The WordPress/core-browser follow-up is smaller but still real: it moves the
same hot20 proof from `165s` to `153s` by removing another roughly `22k`
third-party entities from the hot four-repo slice. Because API/PHP still spends
about `49.6s` in canonical write under concurrent four-large load, this does
not change the next strategic target: NornicDB canonical entity write-path
efficiency and the large code-call shared projection cycle matter more than
additional tiny default skip rules.

API `/api/v0/iac/dead` and MCP `find_dead_iac` both returned `truth_basis=materialized_reducer_rows`, `analysis_status=materialized_reachability`, and `findings_count=8`, with only the expected unused/ambiguous Terraform modules, Helm charts, Ansible roles, and Kustomize bases. Classification: correctness/materialization work, not a reducer throughput win. | Keep this verifier as the reusable golden proof and expand future IaC families only with the same materialized evidence contract and API/MCP parity. |

| Semantic first-generation retry retract | Proven | Stopped full-corpus run at `4844348e` reached projector `878` succeeded and reducer `7563` succeeded, but left `5` semantic-entity materialization dead letters from `graph_write_timeout` in `semantic_retract` for retried first-generation rows. Commit `ac574af5` fixes the guard so semantic retries skip retract whenever no prior generation exists, while still retracting when a prior generation is present. Focused TDD covered prior-generation retract and retried first-generation skip. Remote proof `pcg-semantic-retry5-ac574af5-20260430T220947Z` rebuilt Linux binaries and reran a fresh no-symlink copy of the five failing repositories against NornicDB; queue-empty progress ran from `2026-04-30T22:11:05Z` to `2026-04-30T22:13:53Z`, ending healthy with projector `5/5`, reducer `40/40`, `0` failed/dead-lettered items, and no `semantic_retract` / `graph_write_timeout` failures. Semantic handlers all reported `skip_retract=true`; the largest item loaded `151776` facts, wrote `2422` rows, and completed in `3.417s` total with `1.431s` graph write time. Runtime sampling remained idle-heavy after drain (`cpu idle` about `97%`, `io_wait=0%`, disk util `0%`). | Correctness and tail-risk removal, not a worker-count tuning win. Re-run the next larger/full proof with this guard so semantic retries cannot recreate the previous full-corpus dead-letter tail. |
| Typed repository relationship graph truth | Proven | Commit `8dd2ad7e` replaces FOREACH-routed typed repository relationship writes with direct relationship-type statements. Focused private `45`-repository validation used a materialized corpus with no symlinked repo roots and rebuilt Linux binaries against NornicDB `v1.0.43`. The first local run was rejected because an older local graph binary refused connections under projector concurrency and did not test graph truth. The remote correctness-first rerun used `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS=1`, drained cleanly from first ingester log at `2026-04-29T20:41:46Z` to queue-empty progress at `2026-04-29T20:42:49Z`, and ended with projector `45/45`, reducer `482/482`, `0` failed/dead-lettered items, and no `ERROR` / timeout / connection-refused logs. Direct persisted-graph inspection showed `45` `Repository` nodes and typed repository edges: `DEPLOYS_FROM=30`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=1`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=58`. The target service had `16` incoming repository relationships: GitOps and Helm `DEPLOYS_FROM` plus Terraform / provisioning `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR`. Workload graph truth materialized one `Workload` and two GitOps `WorkloadInstance` nodes for the target service; Terraform/ECS evidence remained represented as repository relationships rather than workload instances. | Use the remaining Terraform/ECS workload-instance gap as the next correlation-truth investigation; do not treat repository-edge success as full deployment-story success |
| Terraform IAM config-read relationship truth | Implemented locally | Commit `ce9a2e5d` adds `TERRAFORM_IAM_PERMISSION` evidence and canonical `READS_CONFIG_FROM` repository edges for Terraform IAM policies that grant SSM read access to another service's `/configd` or `/api` path. Focused TDD proves that IAM/SSM config-read resources no longer emit misleading `TERRAFORM_CONFIG_PATH` / `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR` evidence, while ordinary non-IAM Terraform config paths still provision dependencies. Reducer routing preserves the new evidence type, the NornicDB/Neo4j writer emits direct `READS_CONFIG_FROM` edges, retraction includes the new verb, and repository/query surfaces include the verb in relationship/dependency/consumer reads. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/relationships ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j ./internal/query -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/relationships ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j ./internal/query -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and strict MkDocs. | Push, rebuild remote Linux binaries, and validate against a focused real-repo slice before backfilling or rerunning larger corpora. |
| Observed AWS Terraform resource classification | Implemented locally | Commit `139f2a7c` preserves `provider`, `resource_type`, `resource_service`, and `resource_category` on Terraform resource/data-source parser rows, canonical graph nodes, repository infrastructure responses, and `/api/v0/infra/resources/search` results. The service-family map now covers high-volume AWS resource families observed in the local and remote corpora, including app autoscaling, API Gateway, plural subnet/route data sources, VPC peering, gateways, DMS/DocDB, SSO, DataSync, Transfer, CloudFormation, and caller identity. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/terraformschema ./internal/parser ./internal/content/shape ./internal/projector ./internal/query ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query ./internal/parser ./internal/terraformschema ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1`, `git diff --check`, a prohibited private-term scan over touched files, and strict MkDocs. | Push, rebuild remote Linux binaries, run a focused no-symlink AWS Terraform corpus, and inspect raw graph/API JSON before claiming full-corpus coverage. |
| AWS Terraform demo-corpus coverage and NornicDB variable brace fallback | Implemented locally | Commit `aa3853d0` expands the Terraform service-category map for every previously generic AWS Terraform type observed in the remote corpus and narrows the NornicDB singleton fallback to Terraform variable metadata that carries brace-bearing `default`, `var_type`, or `description` values. Corpus-wide remote source scan found `375` distinct `aws_*` Terraform resource/data-source types; before this slice, `60` landed in the generic `infrastructure` category, including AMI, volume attachment, Lake Formation, Identity Store, Glue, WAF Regional, Security Hub, and default VPC/security/network resources. After the map update the same scan reports `total=375 infrastructure=0`. Remote focused proof `aws-terraform-classification-20260501T222220Z` also exposed a real NornicDB parser dead letter on a TerraformVariable description containing `{}` even though the previous fallback handled only `default` braces; focused TDD now covers both default-map and description-brace fallbacks while preserving batched TerraformLocal interpolation rows. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/terraformschema ./internal/parser ./internal/query ./internal/storage/neo4j ./cmd/ingester ./cmd/bootstrap-index ./cmd/reducer -count=1`. Rebuilt remote proof `aws-terraform-classification-20260501T224237Z` was stopped as too slow after proving the first repo projected and reduced cleanly: source-local projection took `140.627s`, with TerraformVariable `1260` rows in `71.490s`, TerraformResource `779` rows in `30.201s`, and reducer follow-on handlers all below `1s` each with queue wait below `4s`. The second repo did not dead-letter before the stop, but it spent `90.362s` in TerraformLocal canonical writes with `0` singleton statements, confirming this six-Terraform-heavy-repo proof is measuring serialized NornicDB source-local canonical write cost, not reducer throughput. Fast targeted proof `aws-terraform-brace-fixture-20260501T225638Z` then rebuilt and ran a one-repo git fixture with brace-bearing Terraform variable defaults, descriptions, and object types. It drained healthy with projector `1/1`, reducer `7/7`, queue `0`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Projection succeeded in `0.035s`; NornicDB logged TerraformVariable `rows=3`, `singleton_statements=3`, `total_duration_s=0.0086`, and TerraformLocal `rows=1`, `singleton_statements=0`, `total_duration_s=0.0030`, proving the fallback catches variable braces while preserving batched locals. Classification: correctness/demo-truth coverage plus rejected six-heavy-repo serialized proof as a reducer signal. | Keep the one-repo brace fixture as the fast NornicDB projection proof, and keep the `375/375` source classifier coverage as the fast demo-readiness proof. Do not use six serialized Terraform-heavy repos as the reducer iteration loop. |
| Focused deployment-story graph truth | In progress | Commits `c3aea59c`, `e2dcecda`, and `cd6edbd7` fix reducer workload/platform projection gaps found by a focused `61`-repository relationship corpus built from real repo copies, not symlinks. `c3aea59c` infers Kubernetes runtime platforms for admitted service candidates with deployment-source evidence even when the source repo only has Docker/runtime evidence. `e2dcecda` preserves explicit infrastructure-cluster evidence when service modules appear in the same Terraform stack. `cd6edbd7` prefers explicit Terraform cluster-name locals over incidental data-source or service-module handles for platform names. Focused TDD covered the positive Kubernetes deployment-source case, negative no-platform cases, explicit cluster plus service-module inference, and platform naming from cluster evidence. Local and remote verification passed `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and prohibited-term scans on changed files. The rebuilt remote proof against NornicDB `v1.0.43` drained healthy with projector `61/61`, reducer `655/655`, queue `0`, `0` failed/dead-lettered items, no sampled `ERROR` / timeout / connection-refused logs, and queue-empty progress from `2026-04-29T21:39:56Z` to `2026-04-29T21:41:14Z` (`~78s`). Final resource samples remained unsaturated (`99%` CPU idle, `0%` IO wait). Direct persisted-graph inspection showed `61` repository nodes; repo-edge inventory `DEPENDS_ON=6`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=40`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=14`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=65`, `USES_MODULE=4`; GitHub Actions evidence materialized `25` repo relationships; the target service had `18` typed repository relationships, `5` Kubernetes `RUNS_ON` workload-instance edges, and the legacy infrastructure stack now provisions one ECS platform named from explicit cluster evidence. Commits `398c51e0`, `414a4b54`, `8e88c753`, and `a3437d14` then bridge strongly resolved infrastructure provisioning into workload runtime platforms without treating generic dependency evidence as runtime truth. `398c51e0` adds the reducer-side provisioning bridge, `414a4b54` replays workload materialization for the target repo after provisioned dependency projection, `8e88c753` uses scalar provisioned-platform graph lookups for NornicDB compatibility, and `a3437d14` carries provisioning evidence kinds through workload candidates so only platform-shaped Terraform evidence can create provisioned `RUNS_ON` rows. Focused regression tests cover the positive single-platform bridge and the negative generic dependency case. Rebuilt remote proof at `a3437d14` drained healthy in `33s` with projector `61/61`, reducer `659/659`, queue `0`, and no failed/dead-lettered items. Direct graph proof for the target service showed `8` `RUNS_ON` rows: `5` Kubernetes rows from deployment-source evidence plus `3` ECS rows from the unambiguous provisioning stack, with the previous Lambda false positives removed. Durable relationship-store proof showed the broader vocabulary remained present across `20` evidence-kind groups, including GitHub Actions, Kustomize/Helm, ArgoCD discovery, Terraform module/dependency, and platform-shaped Terraform evidence. | Correctness win, not a throughput win. Remaining graph-truth gap: validate the same deployment story through API/query surfaces and then carry the focused proof into a larger mixed corpus before treating this as full-corpus relationship truth. |
| Current mixed-20 reducer sanity | Proven | Remote proof `pcg-reducer-hot20-current-b954-20260430T025342Z` rebuilt Linux binaries at `b954fd63` and reran the mixed `20`-repository performance corpus after the reducer/query-truth fixes. The run drained healthy in `151s` with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, shared projection `code_calls 36832/36832`, repo dependency intents `3/3`, and no failed/dead-lettered queue items. Reducer handler sums were led by `semantic_entity_materialization` (`55.058s`, max `26.770s`), `workload_materialization` (`13.281s`, max `2.714s`), `code_call_materialization` (`13.238s`, max `3.671s`), `sql_relationship_materialization` (`9.798s`, max `2.773s`), and `inheritance_materialization` (`9.259s`, max `1.924s`). Queue wait remained visible in `deployment_mapping` (`1009.923s` sum, max `73.198s`) and SQL (`122.264s` sum, max `33.320s`). Resource samples stayed unsaturated but busier than the tiny focused corpus: `cpu_idle_avg=57.09%`, `io_wait_avg=3.05%`, `disk_idle_avg=78.46%`. | Current-branch sanity proof: healthy and faster than prior hot20 deferred-index proof (`205s`), but not attributed to the query-truth fix. Keep using mixed-20 before 100/full-corpus runs and focus next reducer work on measured semantic/code-call/write-shape hot paths rather than worker-count increases. |
| Terraform runtime service module truth | Proven | Commits `9ce9dc64`, `20723f7b`, and `94ca93d8` fix a focused graph-truth miss where Terraform service modules proved a runtime platform but only generic provisioning evidence reached workload materialization. `9ce9dc64` preserves platform-shaped Terraform service evidence such as `TERRAFORM_ECS_SERVICE` and `TERRAFORM_LAMBDA_SERVICE`; `20723f7b` first allowed service-stack cluster data to form a platform row; `94ca93d8` tightened that to the service module's own `cluster_name` reference so unrelated data sources do not become runtime truth. Focused TDD covered runtime-service evidence extraction, service-evidence projection, service module plus cluster reference platform inference, and the existing generic-provisioning negative case. Remote proof used a fresh no-symlink private `23`-repository corpus with rebuilt Linux binaries at `94ca93d8`: run `pcg-focused-two-api-node-services-20260430T015820Z` drained in `36s`, ending with projector `23/23`, reducer `237/237`, no failed/dead-lettered items, and unsaturated resources after bootstrap (`cpu_idle` returning to `96%`, `io_wait` `0-1%`, disk util `0-0.1%`). Durable evidence retained the full vocabulary, including `TERRAFORM_ECS_SERVICE=19` and `TERRAFORM_LAMBDA_SERVICE=6`. Direct graph inspection showed `4` workloads, `17` workload instances, `16` instance-level `DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE` rows, and `21` `RUNS_ON` rows. The two target services now have Kubernetes deployment-source/runtime rows plus ECS rows for Terraform-backed environments; the intermediate broad data-source attempt was rejected because it created unrelated platform names. Commit `befbc42a` then fixed the query-surface follow-up: workload/service story assembly now preserves every runtime platform target for a materialized instance instead of keeping only the first `RUNS_ON` row. Focused tests cover multi-platform instance reads, deployment overview platform counts, story text, and deployment-fact emission. Rebuilt remote API validation against the same focused graph first confirmed the `local_authoritative` capability gate for full platform-truth routes, then ran the API with the `local_full_stack` profile to exercise the query surfaces. Repository context, service context, service story, and deployment trace all returned `200`; service context and deployment trace agreed on the same Kubernetes plus ECS runtime targets, instance counts, deployment sources, consumers, and provisioning chains as the direct graph proof. | Correctness/truth win, not a wall-clock win: the focused corpus remained `35-36s`. Carry this into a larger mixed corpus before treating the Terraform service-module lane as fully accepted. |
| Multi-verb service evidence graph truth | Proven | Commit `6bf0a737` fixes two reducer admission gaps exposed by a focused private `17`-repository multi-evidence corpus built from real repo copies with no symlinked roots. The pre-fix rebuilt proof at `2a1d278e` drained healthy in `18s` with projector `17/17`, reducer `145/145`, queue `0`, and no failed/dead-lettered work, but direct graph inspection showed repository relationships only: `DEPLOYS_FROM=2`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=1`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=6`, with `0` `Workload` and `0` `RUNS_ON` rows. Durable facts proved the target Node service had Jenkins entry-point evidence, a GitHub Actions workflow artifact, Kustomize/Helm deployment evidence, Terraform provisioning evidence, SQL reducer coverage in the corpus, and Lambda repository references; reducer logs showed `candidate_count=1` but `workload_row_count=0`, so the bug was materialization admission, not missing source data. `6bf0a737` makes GitHub Actions `artifact_type=github_actions_workflow` count as controller provenance and recomputes workload classification after resolved deployment evidence enriches a controller-style candidate. Focused TDD first failed on both cases and then passed, with local verification `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1`. Rebuilt remote proof at `6bf0a737` drained healthy in `23s` with projector `17/17`, reducer `160/160`, queue `0`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Direct graph proof showed `17` `Repository` nodes, `2` `Workload` nodes, `4` `WorkloadInstance` nodes, `RUNS_ON=4`, and `DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE=4`; the target Node service now materializes as a `service` workload with four Kubernetes environment instances from deployment-source evidence. Repository-edge proof remained intact: `DEPLOYS_FROM=2`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=1`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=5` in the graph, with durable evidence kinds `ARGOCD_APPLICATIONSET_DISCOVERY`, `HELM_VALUES_REFERENCE`, `KUSTOMIZE_RESOURCE_REFERENCE`, `TERRAFORM_APP_REPO`, `TERRAFORM_CONFIG_PATH`, and `TERRAFORM_SSM_PARAMETER`. The same proof showed parsed artifact coverage for Ansible roles/tasks/vars, GitHub Actions workflows, Dockerfiles, Helm/templates, and Terraform, and the SQL reducer wrote `643` relationship rows for the data-pipeline repo. Query-surface validation then found NornicDB-sensitive API read shapes, not reducer misses: optional map projections and chained instance-platform traversals returned literal expressions or dropped instance IDs. Commits `5912dd39`, `73424bd0`, and `c3815ca5` route workload/service context and repository context counts through scalar read queries with focused regression tests. Rebuilt API proof at `c3815ca5` returned `200` for repositories, repository context, service context, workload context, service story, repository story, and deployment trace. Repository context now reports `file_count=372`, `workload_count=1`, `platform_count=4`, `consumers=3` (`helm-charts`, `iac-eks-argocd`, `terraform-stack-datax`), `deployment_artifacts=2`, and `entry_points=257`. Service context, service story, and deployment trace agree on workload `workload:api-node-datax`, four Kubernetes instances (`bg-prod`, `bg-qa`, `ops-prod`, `ops-qa`), GitHub Actions/Jenkins/Helm provenance, two deployment sources (`helm-charts`, `iac-eks-argocd`), and controller/deployment story evidence. | Correctness win. This validates cross-repo deployment evidence upgrading controller-style service repos without over-materializing Lambda repositories or generic provisioning dependencies, and proves graph truth now survives the API/query surfaces for the focused service story. Next proof should expand to a larger mixed corpus. |
| Communicator multi-evidence truth proof | Proven | Rebuilt `pcg`, `pcg-api`, `pcg-ingester`, `pcg-reducer`, and `pcg-bootstrap-index` at `828848fe`, then ran a fresh no-symlink focused `9`-repository corpus around `api-node-communicator`, `lambda-api-communicator`, Terraform/config/release automation, GitHub workflow-library repos, and Helm chart context. Run `pcg-focused-communicator-multievidence-20260430` drained healthy in about `12s`: projector `9/9`, reducer `76/76`, queue `pending=0 in_flight=0 retrying=0 dead_letter=0 failed=0`. The run was too short for useful in-flight resource sampling; the first monitor samples landed after drain and showed idle-heavy host state (`cpu idle 99-100%`, primary disk util `0%` in the immediate post-drain sample). Direct graph proof showed `9` `Repository` nodes, one `Workload` (`workload:api-node-communicator`, kind `service`), `0` `WorkloadInstance`, `0` `RUNS_ON`, and `0` `DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE`. Durable relationship proof wrote `4` `DEPLOYS_FROM` relationships from GitHub Actions reusable-workflow evidence and `3` `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR` relationships from Terraform evidence; the Terraform edge into `api-node-communicator` aggregated `31` evidence facts across `TERRAFORM_APP_REPO`, `TERRAFORM_CONFIG_PATH`, and `TERRAFORM_SSM_PARAMETER`, and the Lambda repo remained provisioning evidence rather than an over-materialized workload instance. API proof with `PCG_QUERY_PROFILE=local_full_stack` returned `200` for repositories, repository story, service context, service story, and deployment trace. The service trace matched graph truth: `mapping_mode=none`, `instance_count=0`, `platform_count=0`, `deployment_source_count=0`, `overall_confidence_reason=config_only_evidence`, and limitation `config_environments_present_without_materialized_runtime_instances`; service context still exposed Jenkins controller provenance, Docker/runtime artifacts, SQL migration commands, API surface, config environments, and one Terraform provisioning chain. | Correctness/truth proof. This is not a reducer bug: current workload instance materialization requires resolved `DEPLOYS_FROM` deployment evidence such as ArgoCD, Helm, or Kustomize; Terraform `app_repo` is intentionally `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR` and should enrich provisioning chains without fabricating runtime instances. Next service-story proof should deliberately select a second service with explicit Helm/Argo/Kustomize deployment evidence if the goal is `WorkloadInstance` / `RUNS_ON` validation. |
| Communicator ArgoCD control-plane follow-up | Proven for discovery, still no runtime instance | Rebuilt remote binaries at `b937650d` and reran a fresh no-symlink `11`-repository corpus that added `iac-eks-argocd` and core automation to the previous communicator, Terraform, config, workflow-library, and `helm-charts` set. Run `pcg-focused-communicator-dual-20260430Tnow` drained healthy with projector `11/11`, reducer `98/98`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Manual finalization measured about `146s` because the temporary harness had a SQL quoting bug after the queue was already healthy; reducer handler evidence was small (`workload_materialization` handler sum `2.160s`, max `0.223s`; `deployment_mapping` sum `0.961s`, max `0.140s`) and resource monitoring stayed idle-heavy. Durable evidence included `49` `ARGOCD_APPLICATIONSET_DISCOVERY` facts resolving to one `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN` relationship for `helm-charts`, plus Terraform provisioning chains into `api-node-communicator` (`31` facts) and `lambda-api-communicator` (`4` facts). Commit `b75a0473` then replaced the narrow file-name gate with generic ApplicationSet Git file-generator YAML/JSON parameter evaluation: arbitrary matched generator files are flattened into template params, simple inline `{{ .field }}` values are evaluated, recursive `**` generator paths are supported, and unsupported Go-template expressions remain discovery-only. TDD covers positive evaluated deploy-source, negative shared-chart/config data that must not invent deploy-source, ambiguous unsupported-template behavior, and broad-alias protection for raw template strings. Remote proof `pcg-focused-communicator-appset-b75-20260430T011653Z` rebuilt `pcg`, `pcg-api`, `pcg-ingester`, `pcg-reducer`, and `pcg-bootstrap-index`, drained from first progress at `2026-04-30T01:16:57Z` to queue-empty at `2026-04-30T01:17:09Z`, and ended healthy with projector `11/11`, reducer `101/101`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Durable evidence still shows `49` `ARGOCD_APPLICATIONSET_DISCOVERY` facts and no `ARGOCD_APPLICATIONSET_DEPLOY_SOURCE` for this shared chart/config shape; resolved repo edges are `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=1`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=7`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=4`, and `DEPENDS_ON=2`. Direct persisted-graph inspection shows repository edges `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=1`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=5`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=3`, `DEPENDS_ON=1`, one `Workload` for `api-node-communicator`, and `0` `WorkloadInstance` rows. Runtime samples during the drain stayed unsaturated after startup (`cpu idle` rising from `74%` during bootstrap to `96-100%`, `io_wait` returning to `0%`, disk util returning to `0-11.1%`). | Corrects the extraction model without changing reducer concurrency: ApplicationSet file generators are generic JSON/YAML param sources, not a fixed org-specific file contract. The focused source still does not explicitly identify `api-node-communicator` as an ApplicationSet-deployed source, so PCG correctly preserves discovery/provenance and does not fabricate runtime instances from shared chart client/config entries. Next graph-truth proof should select a service whose generated params explicitly resolve to the service repo, or expand the corpus to include that concrete deploy-source evidence. |
| Source-local content search indexing | In progress | Commits `32d61a6a` and `0f26b3e3` added opt-in local-authoritative content search index deferral plus repo-count-gated restore readiness. Evidence: `pcg-reducer-onebig-deferred-index-code-20260429T115343Z` drained in `152s` versus `188s` default; `pcg-reducer-small-deferred-index-code-20260429T115724Z` drained in `14s`; the first hot20 proof exposed early restore and stayed flat at `239s`; fixed proof `pcg-reducer-hot20-deferred-index-fixed-20260429T121040Z` drained in `205s`, restored indexes post-drain in `1m45.272s`, and ended with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 57987/57987`, CPU idle `63.21%`, and disk idle `81.71%`. | Promote only as a local-authoritative proof/load knob; next optimize canonical graph write and large code-call shared projection cycles before the 100-repo/full-corpus ladder |
| Browser-library data-shape pruning | In progress | Commit `d5e83166` adds signature-based discovery skips for copied browser libraries while keeping authored `src/bootstrap.js`-style files. Focused tests passed; `pcg-reducer-onebig-browserlib-prune-d5e-20260429T133457Z` moved one-large wall `152s` to `99s`; `pcg-reducer-large4-browserlib-prune-d5e-20260429T133758Z` moved four-large wall `192s` to `154s`; `pcg-reducer-hot20-browserlib-prune-d5e-20260429T134509Z` moved hot20 wall `205s` to `165s`, with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 37881/37881`, CPU idle `59.96%`, and disk idle `79.69%`. | Estimate full-corpus impact, then continue with remaining canonical entity write hot paths or run the 100-repo ladder |
| WordPress/core-browser data-shape pruning | In progress | Commit `0a838916` skips WordPress core dirs, `.min.mjs`, and signed JWPlayer/Prototype/reveal browser runtimes. Focused collector tests and `go vet ./internal/collector` passed. Runtime evidence: API/PHP one-large `pcg-reducer-api-wordpress-runtime-0a8-20260429T1405Z` drained in `107s`; 4-large `pcg-reducer-large4-wpcore-runtime-0a8-20260429T1410Z` moved `154s` to `141s`; hot20 `pcg-reducer-hot20-wpcore-runtime-0a8-20260429T1415Z` moved `165s` to `153s`, with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 36832/36832`, CPU idle `54.23%`, and disk idle `76.57%`. | Keep as modest wall-clock win; next stop chasing tiny skip rules and measure canonical entity write-path or code-call shared projection changes |
| Generated-template local ignore upper-bound | In progress | Commit `4da1c6a7` contains only evidence anonymization and no runtime behavior change. A temp-only repo-local ignore proof measured whether a generated PHP template family explains source-local/canonical write time before adding any OSS classifier. One-large `pcg-reducer-large-templateignore-4da-20260429T1535Z` moved wall `107s` to `62s`, files `4724` to `3595`, facts `128854` to `75732`, content entities `119398` to `68534`, content write `17.489s` to `8.858s`, canonical write `30.698s` to `19.138s`, and `Variable` rows `103908` to `57080`; CPU idle `85.11%`, IO wait `0.67%`, disk idle `92.88%`. Four-large `pcg-reducer-large4-templateignore-4da-20260429T1550Z` moved wall `141s` to `133s`, with projector `4/4`, reducer `32/32`, `code_calls 29935/29935`, CPU idle `65.00%`, IO wait `1.89%`, disk idle `80.58%`. Hot20 `pcg-reducer-hot20-templateignore-4da-20260429T1600Z` moved wall `153s` to `137s`, with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 36830/36830`, `repo_dependency 3/3`, CPU idle `56.05%`, IO wait `2.60%`, disk idle `77.48%`. Commit `0376d44f` adds a generic operator-controlled discovery path-glob overlay (`PCG_DISCOVERY_IGNORED_PATH_GLOBS`, `PCG_DISCOVERY_PRESERVED_PATH_GLOBS`) for bootstrap-index, collector-git, and ingester so future proofs do not require temp harness edits or committed corpus-specific rules. Commit `e0b7e7ad` records the first overlay follow-up. With rebuilt binaries and the real env overlay, `pcg-reducer-large-envtemplate-e0b-20260429T1625Z` drained the same one-large proof in `59s`, with projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, `code_calls 2251/2251`, `files_skipped.user.generated-template=1122`, files `3602`, facts `75830`, content entities `68618`, content write `8.760s`, canonical write `18.487s`, `Variable` rows `57164`, CPU idle `86.67%`, IO wait `0.67%`, and disk idle `92.33%`. Small no-match validation `pcg-reducer-small-envtemplate-e0b-20260429T1635Z` drained in `13s`, with projector `1/1`, reducer `8/8`, `code_calls 32/32`, CPU idle `97.00%`, IO wait `0.00%`, and disk idle `95.44%`. Commit `5df7e70b` was rebuilt remotely before the real four-large and hot20 overlay proofs. `pcg-reducer-large4-envtemplate-5df-20260429T1705Z` drained in `135s`, with projector `4/4`, reducer `32/32`, `code_calls 29935/29935`, CPU idle `63.37%`, IO wait `2.21%`, and disk idle `80.13%`. `pcg-reducer-hot20-envtemplate-5df-20260429T1710Z` drained in `137s`, with projector `20/20`, reducer `160/160`, `code_calls 36830/36830`, `repo_dependency 3/3`, CPU idle `56.10%`, IO wait `2.75%`, and disk idle `76.02%`. Commit `c1d5675b` was rebuilt remotely before the 100-repo overlay proof. A first 100-repo run exposed a temp harness owner-file selection bug but durable state was healthy; the clean rerun `pcg-reducer-100-envtemplate-c1d-ownerfix-20260429T1745Z` drained in `81s`, with projector `100/100`, reducer `768/768`, `code_calls 7293/7293`, `repo_dependency 9/9`, semantic handler sum `31.654s`, workload handler sum `26.477s`, max reducer handler `3.335s`, CPU idle `76.75%`, IO wait `2.00%`, and disk idle `82.59%`. | Treat the generic overlay as validated through the 100-repo ladder. Next proof can be full corpus or a deliberately large-biased 100-repo set if we want one more tail-risk check first. Decide separately whether production should supply repo-local config or deployment-level overlay values. Do not hardcode corpus names or domain-specific strings. |
| Repo-dependency shared projection telemetry | In progress | Commit `f581dc79` adds repo-dependency cycle substep telemetry before changing concurrency: `selection`, `load_all`, `acceptance_prefetch`, `retract`, `write`, `replay`, and `mark_completed` durations, plus processed, active, stale, acceptance-unit-row, and replay-request counts. Focused TDD: `go test ./internal/reducer -run TestRepoDependencyProjectionRunnerRecordCycleLogsSubstepDurations -count=1`; broader local verification: `go test ./internal/reducer ./internal/telemetry -count=1` and `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/telemetry -count=1`. | Rebuild remote binaries after this slice lands and rerun a focused repo-dependency proof before adding indexes or partitioning. Use the new fields to classify whether the `repo_dependency` tail is Postgres loading, accepted-generation prefetch, NornicDB retract/write, replay enqueue, or completion marking. |
| NornicDB compose relationship correctness | Proven | Commits `624aad27` and `ad5a8ede` fix correctness gaps found while validating the NornicDB Compose stack after the reducer throughput work. `624aad27` stops repository context from promoting generic Helm/Kubernetes YAML containing `hosts:` into `ansible_playbook` evidence and dedupes repeated relationship facts before insert. `ad5a8ede` corrects deferred relationship backfill ownership so corpus-wide backfill persists source-file evidence under the active source repository generation instead of duplicating the same source-to-target relationship under the target generation. Focused TDD covered Helm values and Kubernetes Ingress negative cases, real Ansible playbook positives, duplicate upsert inputs, and deferred backfill source-generation ownership. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/query ./internal/storage/postgres ./internal/relationships -count=1`. Rebuilt remote NornicDB Compose validation at `ad5a8ede` drained cleanly with `45` repositories, queue `succeeded=378`, healthy API/MCP/ingester/reducer/Postgres/NornicDB services, and no recent error/failed/panic/fatal/dead-letter/timeout logs. Durable evidence is now `HELM_VALUES_REFERENCE=2` and `KUSTOMIZE_RESOURCE_REFERENCE=2`, duplicate evidence groups are `0`, duplicate resolved relationship groups are `0`, persisted `DEPLOYS_FROM=4`, graph `DEPLOYS_FROM=4`, and repository context for the Helm/Kubernetes fixtures reports no synthetic `ansible_playbook` config paths while preserving Helm relationship overview. | Correctness/API-truth win, not a throughput win. Keep this as a gate before larger NornicDB proof runs so performance measurements are not polluted by duplicate durable relationship rows or false evidence labels. |
| Bootstrap NornicDB canonical write safety | Proven | Commit `76a0909f` fixes a NornicDB Compose blocker found by the mixed representative corpus: `pcg-bootstrap-index` still used the plain grouped canonical writer while `pcg-ingester` already used bounded NornicDB phase groups, per-label caps, file caps, and write timeouts. The first mixed `24`-repository attempt at `add8bdb5` failed before reducer validation with `Txn is too big to fit into one request` during source-local canonical projection for a roughly `10k`-fact repository, so that run was invalid as reducer evidence. The fix moves bootstrap canonical writes onto the same NornicDB-safe bounded phase-group path and adds regression coverage proving the bootstrap executor exposes `PhaseGroupExecutor`, not raw `GroupExecutor`, by default. Local verification passed `go test ./cmd/bootstrap-index ./cmd/ingester -count=1` plus `git diff --check`. After rebuilding remote Linux binaries and Compose images, run `pcg-nornicdb-mixed24-20260430T123300Z-76a0909f` drained healthy in `43s`: `24` active generations, `207` succeeded work items, `0` failed/dead-letter/retrying rows, bootstrap collection completed for `24` scopes, bootstrap projection completed all `24` items in `17.752s`, graph counts matched persisted relationship truth (`Repository=24`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=6`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=2`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=2`), duplicate resolved relationship groups were `0`, duplicate evidence IDs were `0`, and durable evidence retained representative ArgoCD, Helm, Kustomize, and Terraform evidence kinds. Resource samples averaged `68.72%` CPU idle, `0.00%` IO wait, and `61.20%` disk idle; the only error log hits were two manual SQL mistakes during evidence collection after the drain. Reducer log telemetry showed low handler time on this corpus: semantic entity materialization `8` items / `1.819s` handler sum / `0.975s` max, workload materialization `31` items / `1.671s` sum / `0.468s` max, SQL relationship materialization `24` items / `0.790s` sum / `0.301s` max, and deployment mapping `47` items / `1.253s` sum / `0.131s` max. | Correctness/runtime-gate win that unblocks mixed NornicDB proof runs. It should not be counted as reducer throughput improvement; the reducer was not reached in the failed baseline. Next reducer tuning should use the now-healthy mixed corpus to choose a larger, reducer-heavy corpus where semantic/workload/shared projection handler time is non-trivial. |
| Repository edge evidence pointers | Proven locally and remotely | Commit `5d3ebfec` makes graph repository edges evidence-first without embedding full durable evidence in the graph. Reducer shared intents now carry `resolved_id`, `generation_id`, `evidence_count`, `evidence_kinds`, `resolution_source`, `confidence`, and `rationale`; Neo4j/NornicDB repo-edge writes persist those fields for `DEPENDS_ON`, `DEPLOYS_FROM`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR`, and `USES_MODULE`; repository context exposes the same lightweight evidence pointers so callers can query Postgres `resolved_relationships` for full details. Focused TDD covered deterministic resolved IDs, cross-repo resolver intent payloads, typed and fallback repo-edge graph writes, and repository context output. Local verification: `go test ./internal/relationships ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j ./internal/storage/postgres ./internal/query -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and prohibited-term scan clean. Remote proof after rebuilding `pcg`, `pcg-api`, `pcg-ingester`, `pcg-reducer`, and `pcg-bootstrap-index`: 61-repo focused relationship corpus produced `629/629` succeeded work items, first item created at `2026-04-30T16:31:38Z`, last update at `2026-04-30T16:32:12Z`, and no failed/dead-lettered work. Direct NornicDB graph inspection showed every materialized repository relationship had the new evidence pointers: `DEPENDS_ON=6/6`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=41/41`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=14/14`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=65/65`, and `USES_MODULE=4/4` with `resolved_id`, `generation_id`, `evidence_count`, and `evidence_kinds` present. Postgres reconciliation matched the same relationship counts in `resolved_relationships` and sample `resolved_id` rows returned full `details.evidence_preview` payloads. API repository context on the live NornicDB-backed stack returned relationship overview entries with `resolved_id`, `generation_id`, `evidence_count`, `evidence_kinds`, `resolution_source`, and `rationale`. Commit `88c7ccf3` keeps the legacy outgoing `relationships` array but makes `relationship_overview` include both incoming and outgoing typed repository edges with `direction`, `source_*`, `target_*`, `resolved_id`, `generation_id`, `confidence`, evidence counts/kinds, resolution source, and rationale. Local verification: `go test ./internal/query -run 'TestServeOpenAPI|TestGetRepositoryContextIncludesTypedRelationshipOverview' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/query -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and prohibited-term scan clean. Remote rebuilt-API proof against the same focused NornicDB dataset returned `20` relationship-overview entries for the target service: `16` incoming, `4` outgoing, and relationship types `DEPLOYS_FROM`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN`, and `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR`; incoming samples carried the expected graph-to-Postgres evidence pointers plus confidence and rationale. | Correctness/query-truth win, not a wall-clock win. Next: use the full-corpus stack to validate the same incoming/outgoing repository story through API and MCP read paths, then move back to reducer performance long poles if query truth stays aligned. |
| Full-corpus repository edge-pointer acceptance | Proven, timing caveated | Fresh NornicDB Compose proof `pcg-nornicdb-fullcorpus-edgeptr-20260430T175535Z-0a7a7a0f` rebuilt at commit `0a7a7a0f` after the bootstrap heartbeat-stop race fix. The first attempt at this proof was invalidated by a startup port collision and then restarted with isolated ports. The older read-validation stack remained live for the first part of the run and was stopped, with volumes preserved, after we noticed it was competing for CPU; therefore this proof is correctness evidence, not a pristine timing benchmark. Terminal queue state was healthy: projector `947/947`, reducer `8384/8384`, `0` failed/dead-lettered rows, and `0` rows with `failure_class`. Bootstrap reported source-local projection complete at `1682.657s` for `947` items and reopened `946` deployment-mapping rows; durable work window was `2026-04-30T18:00:23Z` to `2026-04-30T18:33:26Z` (`1983.593s`). API and MCP health checks passed; MCP JSON-RPC `initialize` and `tools/list` returned successfully with `39` tools. API read-only Cypher verified all materialized repository graph edges had `resolved_id`, `generation_id`, `evidence_count`, and `evidence_kinds`: `DEPENDS_ON=3`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=179`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=153`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=759`, and `USES_MODULE=623`, with `0` missing pointer fields in every type-specific row check. Postgres `resolved_relationships` matched graph distinct source-target-type counts, except `DEPLOYS_FROM` had `181` durable rows and `179` distinct graph-edge identities because two source/target/type pairs had duplicate durable resolutions that collapse to one graph edge each. A target repository context API proof returned `17` relationship overview entries with the same pointer fields and evidence metadata. Resource samples for the whole run were `cpu_idle_avg=46.64%`, `io_wait_avg=0.43%`, and `disk_idle_avg=91.99%`; after the competing stack was stopped, samples shifted to `cpu_idle_avg=73.00%`, `io_wait_avg=0.04%`, and `disk_idle_avg=97.19%`. | Full-corpus graph/API/MCP correctness accepted for edge pointers and heartbeat-stop recovery. Do not use this wall time as the clean performance benchmark because early samples were contaminated by the older full-corpus stack. For a release timing number, rerun one single-stack full-corpus proof from a clean start. |
| Graph evidence story spine | Implemented locally | This slice materializes bounded `EvidenceArtifact` graph nodes from resolved relationship evidence previews and links them through `HAS_DEPLOYMENT_EVIDENCE`, `EVIDENCES_REPOSITORY_RELATIONSHIP`, and `TARGETS_ENVIRONMENT` when a concrete environment path is available. Raw evidence remains in Postgres; graph nodes carry only stable evidence pointers and compact fields such as `resolved_id`, `generation_id`, `evidence_kind`, `artifact_family`, `path`, `matched_alias`, `matched_value`, and `environment`. NornicDB schema support adds single-label lookup anchors for `EvidenceArtifact.id` and `Environment.name`; the writer uses separate environment/no-environment batch statements rather than conditional Cypher. Repo-dependency retraction now also deletes prior evidence artifacts for the same evidence source so graph-story nodes do not outlive their authoritative repo-edge snapshot. Local TDD first failed for missing reducer payload, graph write, and schema support, then passed with `go test ./internal/reducer -run TestBuildResolvedEdgeIntentRowsCarriesEvidenceArtifactsForGraphStory -count=1`, `go test ./internal/storage/neo4j -run TestEdgeWriterWriteEdgesMaterializesRepoEvidenceArtifacts -count=1`, `go test ./internal/graph -run 'TestSchemaStatementsContainsExpectedConstraints|TestSchemaStatementsForBackendAddsNornicDBMergeLookupIndexes' -count=1`, and `go test ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j ./internal/graph -count=1`. | Correctness/query-truth win, not a throughput claim. Next proof should rebuild binaries and run a focused service/deployment corpus, then query the graph directly for evidence artifacts and compare those nodes against Postgres `resolved_relationships` and evidence facts before any API/MCP rendering work. |
| Graph evidence story spine focused proof | Proven | Remote proof `pcg-focused-evidence-spine-a17d1c66-20260430T193633Z` rebuilt Linux binaries at `a17d1c66` and ran a fresh no-symlink `61`-repository focused service/deployment corpus against local-authoritative NornicDB `v1.0.43`. The run reached healthy in `44s` from wrapper start to queue-empty health, ending with projector `61/61`, reducer `568/568`, queue `0`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Direct Bolt graph inspection showed `61` `Repository` nodes, `112611` total nodes, `128626` total edges, and `472` `EvidenceArtifact` nodes. Every graph artifact had both required links: `472` `HAS_DEPLOYMENT_EVIDENCE` source links and `472` `EVIDENCES_REPOSITORY_RELATIONSHIP` target links; `289` artifacts also linked to `Environment` nodes. Postgres reconciliation against `resolved_relationships.details.evidence_preview` matched the graph exactly by distinct artifact key and evidence kind: ArgoCD deploy-source `5`, ArgoCD discovery `17`, GitHub Actions action repo `14`, local reusable workflow `5`, reusable workflow `34`, workflow-input repo `25`, Helm chart `1`, Helm values `32`, Kustomize resource `43`, Terraform app-name `2`, app-repo `12`, config-path `129`, ECS service `31`, GitHub repository `26`, Lambda service `7`, module source `20`, Secrets Manager secret `3`, and SSM parameter `66`. A representative target service graph query showed deployment and provisioning edges with linked Helm/Kustomize/Terraform evidence artifacts, while its outgoing CI/config edges linked GitHub Actions reusable workflow and workflow-input evidence artifacts. | Correctness/query-truth proof accepted for the graph evidence spine. Next step is API/MCP rendering of the graph evidence pointers and targeted validation of API-route/endpoint and CI/deployment story surfaces; this proof is not a reducer throughput claim and does not justify worker-count changes. |
| API endpoint graph materialization | Proven | Commit `e3c5f4b0` makes admitted workload API routes first-class graph truth. Workload candidate extraction now carries endpoint signals from split OpenAPI/Swagger specs, nested path-file refs, and parser-owned `framework_semantics` route contracts; workload materialization writes `Endpoint` nodes and `Repository` / `Workload` `EXPOSES_ENDPOINT` edges while retaining compact provenance (`source_kinds`, `source_paths`, spec/API versions, methods, and operation IDs). Follow-up commit `86c5b872` closes the known framework shape gap by translating parser-owned Next.js route-module metadata (`route_segments`, `route_verbs`) into the same endpoint graph and service-evidence route contract, alongside the existing FastAPI, Flask, Express, and Hapi route-path contract. Commit `0599fbb1` renders graph endpoint truth through repository context `api_surface` so API callers can discover endpoint nodes without hand-written Cypher; OpenAPI now documents that response field. Local TDD first failed for nested OpenAPI path refs, reducer candidate extraction, projection rows, graph writes, Next.js route-module evidence, and missing repository-context `api_surface`, then passed with `go test ./internal/query -run 'TestLoadServiceQueryEvidenceResolves(NestedOpenAPIPathRefs|OpenAPIPathsRef|PerPathItemRef)' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/reducer -run 'TestExtractWorkloadCandidatesIncludes|TestBuildProjectionRowsMaterializesAPIEndpointRows|TestWorkloadMaterializerWritesAPIEndpoints' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/query -run 'TestParseFrameworkSemantics(ExtractsNextJSRouteModules|ExtractsHapiAndExpressRoutes|SkipsFrameworkWithNoRoutes)' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/reducer -run 'TestExtractWorkloadCandidatesIncludes(NextJSRouteEndpoints|FrameworkRouteEndpoints|NestedOpenAPIEndpoints)' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/query -run 'TestServeOpenAPI|TestGetRepositoryContextIncludesGraphAPISurface|TestGetRepositoryContextReturnsEnrichedResponse' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/query ./internal/reducer ./internal/graph -count=1`, `git diff --check`, prohibited-term scan on the diff, and strict MkDocs. Remote proof `pcg-focused-endpoints-e3c5f4b0-20260430T201123Z` rebuilt Linux binaries and ran the fresh no-symlink `61`-repository focused corpus against local-authoritative NornicDB. The run ended healthy with projector `61/61`, reducer `568/568`, queue `0`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Direct Bolt graph inspection showed `194` `Endpoint` nodes, `194` `Repository` -> `Endpoint` edges, and `194` `Workload` -> `Endpoint` edges. A representative split-spec API service exposed `38` endpoint nodes from OpenAPI/Swagger evidence; two additional API services exposed `69` and `10` endpoint nodes. Workload materialization logs reported endpoint write durations from low milliseconds to about `75ms` for those representative services. After pulling `5d5e58cd` on the remote focused stack, rebuilding `pcg-api` and `pcg-mcp-server`, and attaching temporary read services to the same graph, repository context API returned graph-backed `api_surface` counts matching the direct graph counts (`38`, `69`, `10`) with `truth_basis=graph`; MCP `get_repo_context` returned the same graph-backed endpoint count for the representative service. | Correctness/query-truth win, not a reducer throughput claim. Endpoint graph writes are cheap on this focused proof; the value is that API and MCP callers can now discover API surface truth from the graph and then follow graph pointers back to Postgres details. Next validation should include endpoint counts in the next larger graph-truth proof. |
| Repository deployment evidence read surface | Proven | Commit `2d2a52e0` renders compact graph evidence artifacts through repository context as `deployment_evidence`. The read surface uses separate indexed `Repository.id` anchors for outgoing evidence owned by the requested repo and incoming evidence that targets it, then returns graph pointers only: artifact id, family, evidence kind, path, environment, runtime platform kind, relationship type, source/target repo ids, `resolved_id`, `generation_id`, confidence, and `postgres_lookup_basis=resolved_id` when a Postgres drilldown key exists. Local TDD first failed because repository context had no graph-backed deployment-evidence field, then passed with `go test ./internal/query -run TestGetRepositoryContextIncludesGraphDeploymentEvidence -count=1`; neighboring contract checks passed with `go test ./internal/query -run 'TestGetRepositoryContextIncludes(GraphDeploymentEvidence|TypedRelationshipOverview|GraphAPISurface)|TestServeOpenAPI' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/query -count=1`, `go test ./internal/mcp -count=1`, `git diff --check`, prohibited-term scan on changed files, and strict MkDocs. Remote proof pulled `2d2a52e0` into the existing focused NornicDB stack, rebuilt `pcg-api` and `pcg-mcp-server`, and restarted only the temporary read services. Repository context API returned `deployment_evidence.truth_basis=graph`; three representative services returned artifact counts `61`, `19`, and `15`, and direct read-only graph counts for outgoing plus incoming `EvidenceArtifact` nodes matched those API counts exactly. The same representative API proof exposed CI/deployment/environment families such as GitHub Actions, Helm, Kustomize, and Terraform, with environment counts `3`, `4`, and `2`. MCP `get_repo_context` returned the same graph-backed field for the representative service with artifact count `61` and endpoint count `38`. | Correctness/query-truth win, not a reducer throughput claim. This closes the first API/MCP visibility gap for graph evidence pointers; raw evidence remains in Postgres and is reached through the returned `resolved_id` / `generation_id` pointers. Next read-surface work should fold the same graph evidence summary into service context and deployment trace responses so repo, service, and trace views agree without bespoke Cypher. |
| Service and deployment-trace graph read alignment | Proven | Commits `12860e16` and `451d9611` align service context and deployment trace with repository graph truth. `12860e16` moves graph deployment-evidence enrichment ahead of content-store hydration so service and trace reads can surface graph `EvidenceArtifact` pointers even when content evidence is unavailable, while preserving existing content-derived delivery paths when present. It also teaches deployment overview/story summaries to read graph-only `artifact_families`. The first remote proof exposed an adjacent mismatch: repo context used graph endpoint truth but service and trace still preferred content-derived API evidence, returning `39` endpoints versus the repository graph count of `38`. `451d9611` fixes that by querying the same repository graph API surface for service enrichment and only falling back to content-derived API evidence when graph endpoint truth is absent. Local TDD first failed for missing graph deployment evidence and missing graph API surface in service context, then passed. Verification: `go test ./internal/query -run 'TestGetServiceContextIncludesGraphDeploymentEvidenceWithoutContent|TestFetchServiceTraceContextIncludesGraphDeploymentEvidenceWithoutContent' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/query -count=1`, `go test ./internal/mcp -count=1`, `git diff --check`, prohibited-term scan on changed files, and strict MkDocs. Remote proof pulled `451d9611`, rebuilt `pcg-api` and `pcg-mcp-server`, and restarted only temporary read services against the existing focused NornicDB graph. Repository context, service context, and deployment trace all returned matching graph deployment evidence artifact count `61`, matching artifact families GitHub Actions / Helm / Kustomize / Terraform, and matching graph-backed endpoint count `38` with `api_surface.truth_basis=graph` on service and trace responses. MCP `get_service_context` and `trace_deployment_chain` returned the same graph-backed artifact count `61`, endpoint count `38`, and artifact families. | Correctness/query-truth win, not a reducer throughput claim. Repo, service, deployment trace, and MCP now agree on graph endpoint and graph evidence summaries for the representative focused service. Next validation should carry this read-surface agreement into the larger mixed/full corpus proof and then decide whether to add a dedicated Postgres drilldown endpoint for returned `resolved_id` pointers. |
| Reducer lease heartbeat correctness | In progress | Commit `b19e9b5d` adds lease heartbeats to the bootstrap projector drain and the repo-dependency shared projection lane. Commit `67b314f6` records the focused heartbeat proof evidence. Live full-corpus graph-truth validation found durable relationship evidence and resolved relationships for a target service, but graph edges lagged because a long source-local projection exceeded its lease, was re-claimed, and the duplicate graph write failed before deployment-mapping reopen. A targeted replay reopened `17` deployment-mapping items, produced `17` resolved relationships (`2` `DEPLOYS_FROM`, `15` `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR`), and eventually materialized all `17` target consumers in the repository context API. The same replay showed why repo-dependency also needs lease renewal: two small acceptance units with `RUNS_ON` plus repo-edge writes took `280.918s` and `135.723s`, far beyond the default `60s` shared-projection lease, while the later `61`-row unit completed in `0.848s`. Focused TDD covers bootstrap projector heartbeat during blocked projection and repo-dependency heartbeat during blocked graph write. Local verification: `go test ./cmd/bootstrap-index ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`. Rebuilt remote binaries at `67b314f6` and reran the same no-symlink focused `61`-repository relationship corpus against local-authoritative NornicDB. The first attempt failed before indexing because the non-interactive shell did not expose the NornicDB binary; the corrected proof used `PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY`, drained from start to queue-empty in about `43s` (`70s` wrapper wall including manual owner shutdown), and ended healthy with projector `61/61`, reducer `568/568`, queue `0`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Resource samples stayed unsaturated during active drain: CPU idle ranged roughly `38-70%`, IO wait stayed `0%`, and primary disk utilization was mostly `0.1-3.1%`. Direct graph proof showed the target service repository node plus `16` incoming typed repo edges (`2` `DEPLOYS_FROM`, `14` `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR`) and `2` outgoing automation/config edges (`DEPLOYS_FROM`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN`). Durable relationship proof showed the matching `18` resolved relationships with evidence JSON preserved for GitHub Actions reusable workflows, Helm/Kustomize deployment config, and Terraform evidence. | Correctness proof accepted for the heartbeat slice. This does not prove a throughput win: the focused drain is comparable to the earlier `33s` proof and the main value is preventing stale-lease duplicate projection/write races before the next full-corpus acceptance proof. Keep worker defaults unchanged. |
| Bootstrap projector heartbeat stop race | Fixed locally; remote proof invalidated | Full-corpus edge-pointer proof `pcg-nornicdb-fullcorpus-edgeptr-20260430T173243Z-54648f8c` rebuilt at `54648f8c` to validate graph repository-edge evidence pointers on a fresh graph. The run reached `904` succeeded source-local projector items, `6670` succeeded reducer items, and `1,221,221` facts before bootstrap exited with `7` source-local projector rows stranded in `claimed/running`. Reducer work that had been enqueued succeeded, and NornicDB logs had no matching backend error, so this is not evidence of reducer edge-pointer failure. The failure signature was a bootstrap projector heartbeat reporting `context canceled` while projection shutdown was racing with heartbeat stop. Commit `85410592` adds focused regression coverage for both bootstrap and long-running projector heartbeat stop paths and treats heartbeat-store `context.Canceled` from the heartbeat context's own cancellation as a clean stop, while preserving real lease-loss errors. Verification: failing tests reproduced the race before the fix; after the fix `go test ./cmd/bootstrap-index -run TestBootstrapProjectorHeartbeatStopIgnoresStopContextCancellation -count=1`, `go test ./internal/projector -run TestServiceHeartbeatStopIgnoresStopContextCancellation -count=1`, and `go test ./cmd/bootstrap-index ./internal/projector -count=1` passed. | Rebuild remote binaries, remove the invalid edge-pointer proof stack after evidence capture, and rerun the fresh full-corpus edge-pointer proof. Keep the older read-validation stack running unless explicitly stopped. |
| Repo-dependency retract shape | Proven | Live full-corpus old-binary evidence showed the remaining `repo_dependency` tail averaging about `23s` per cycle while writes were only milliseconds: recent `shared edge write completed` rows for `domain=repo_dependency` were typically `0.003s-0.008s`, workload replay logs after the cycle were milliseconds, and read-only Postgres `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on the live run measured pending selection at about `0.497ms` and next acceptance-unit reload at about `1.250ms`. Commit `fccfe2cd` keeps the same repo-wide retract semantics but rewrites the repo-dependency retract Cypher to anchor both repo-relationship and `RUNS_ON` deletion through `UNWIND $repo_ids AS repo_id` plus `MATCH (repo:Repository {id: repo_id})` before traversing relationships. Focused TDD first failed on the old unanchored shape, then passed; verification: `go test ./internal/storage/neo4j -run 'TestEdgeWriterRetractEdgesRepoDependencyDispatch|TestBuildCanonicalRepoRelationshipUpsertStatement|TestBuildCanonicalRunsOnUpsertStatementUsesWorkloadInstanceShape' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/storage/neo4j ./internal/reducer -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j ./internal/reducer -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and prohibited-term scan clean. The rebuilt 100-repo proof `pcg-reducer-100-retract-anchor-7b0-20260429T183811Z` stayed healthy at `81s` with `repo_dependency 9/9`, but repo-dependency cycles still spent `1.635s` of `1.679s` in retract. A stopped full-corpus proof on `7b0741d4` confirmed the full-size tail: after projector `896/896` and `code_calls 114085/114085`, `repo_dependency` reached `103/911`; the first five repo-dependency cycles spent `206.072s` of `206.457s` in retract while writes totaled `0.105s`. Commit `4886478c` therefore skips repo-dependency retract only for true first projections: no completed contributor rows, no stale intents, and no explicit `delete`/`retract` action. Focused TDD failed before the guard and passed after it; verification: `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and prohibited-term scan clean. Rebuilt 100-repo proof `pcg-reducer-100-firstskip-488-20260429T185711Z` stayed healthy at `81s` with `repo_dependency 9/9`; repo-dependency cycle time dropped from `1.679s` to `0.034s`, with `retract_duration_seconds=0` and writes/replay/mark-complete accounting for the remaining milliseconds. Stopped full-corpus proof `pcg-reducer-full-firstskip-488-20260429T185908Z` showed the guard was still too conservative for additive waves: before deployment-mapping replay, `repo_dependency` reached `227/229` with `52` cycles totaling `1.848s`, `max_cycle=0.140s`, and `total_retract=0`; after completed contributor rows entered later acceptance-unit reloads, the same run reached `271/1235` with `70` cycles totaling `328.057s`, `total_retract=324.499s`, and `max_retract=63.107s`. Commit `f13e493f` keeps retracts for stale intents and explicit `delete`/`retract` actions but stops treating completed rows that still match accepted generation truth as invalidation triggers. Focused TDD first failed with one unwanted retract call for an authoritative completed contributor, then passed; verification: `go test ./internal/reducer -run 'TestRepoDependencyProjectionRunner(SkipsRetractForFirstProjection|SkipsRetractWhenCompletedContributorsRemainAuthoritative|RetractsPerEvidenceSourceAndSkipsRetractRowsOnWrite|ProcessesSourceRepoOwnedAcceptance|RehydratesCompletedContributorRows)' -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and prohibited-term scan clean. Rebuilt 100-repo proof `pcg-reducer-100-additive-skip-857-20260429T192131Z` stayed healthy at `81s`, with projector `100/100`, reducer `768/768`, `code_calls 7293/7293`, `repo_dependency 9/9`, CPU idle `75.67%`, IO wait `1.92%`, and disk idle `83.40%`. Repo-dependency cycles stayed in the intended non-destructive path: `2` cycles, `total_cycle=0.035s`, `max_cycle=0.022s`, `total_retract=0`, `total_write=0.009s`, `total_replay=0.015s`, and `total_mark_completed=0.004s`. Full-corpus proof `pcg-reducer-full-additive-skip-857-20260429T192326Z` was stopped as invalid after `88s` because a workload-materialization Platform `MERGE` hit a NornicDB commit-time unique conflict and moved one reducer item to `dead_letter`; this is a correctness gate, not a throughput result. Commit `bc20c6ae` adds a narrow retry classification for NornicDB MERGE unique conflicts while preserving terminal behavior for non-MERGE constraint violations. Focused TDD first failed on the NornicDB conflict shape, then passed; verification: `go test ./internal/storage/neo4j -run 'TestRetryingExecutor(RetriesNornicDBMergeUniqueConflict|DoesNotRetryNornicDBUniqueConflictWithoutMerge|DoesNotRetryPermanentErrors|RetriesOnDeadlock)' -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and prohibited-term scan clean. Rebuilt 100-repo proof `pcg-reducer-100-merge-retry-579-20260429T193231Z` stayed healthy at `79s`, with projector `100/100`, reducer `768/768`, `code_calls 7293/7293`, `repo_dependency 9/9`, CPU idle `72.36%`, IO wait `1.73%`, and disk idle `81.73%`; repo-dependency cycles stayed non-destructive with `total_cycle=0.041s`, `max_cycle=0.022s`, and `total_retract=0`. | Full-corpus proof `pcg-reducer-full-merge-retry-579-20260429T193415Z` exited after `119s` before drain because the remote root volume filled during ingestion; final checkpoint was projector `730/896`, reducer `3222` succeeded, `0` dead letters, and no repo-dependency cycles yet. Treat this as disk-capacity invalid, not a reducer result. Remote cleanup removed regenerated run state and restored root free space to `266G` before the next proof. Fresh rebuilt full-corpus proof `pcg-reducer-full-after-disk-clean-815-20260429T194528Z` drained healthy in `931s`: projector `896/896`, reducer `8284/8284`, `code_calls 118564/118564`, `repo_dependency 2057/2057`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Repo-dependency completed `692` cycles with `total_cycle=22.778s`, `max_cycle=5.691s`, `total_retract=0`, and `4853` written rows; CPU idle averaged `42.16%`, IO wait `2.65%`, and disk idle `81.29%`. Classify this as a full-corpus wall-clock win for the repo-dependency tail. The remaining reducer long poles are `workload_materialization` (`2538` items, `2882.120s` handler sum, `85.171s` max) and `deployment_mapping` (`896` items, `551.067s` handler sum, `41.249s` max), so the next reducer work should target those handler/data-shape paths, not repo-dependency retract or worker-count defaults. |
| Full-corpus overlay proof | Superseded by repo-dependency proof | Run `pcg-reducer-full-envtemplate-a4e-20260429T1810Z` used commit `a4eb9de1` after rebuilding all runtime binaries and enabling the same generic discovery overlay. Interim checkpoints showed projector `896/896`, code-call shared intents complete, and the late tail narrowing to repo-dependency shared projection while CPU and disk remained unsaturated. That run was intentionally superseded by the later repo-dependency retract-shape fixes and clean full-corpus proof. | Use `pcg-reducer-full-after-disk-clean-815-20260429T194528Z` as the authoritative full-corpus evidence for this slice. |
| Explicit canonical entity SET A/B | Rejected | Commit `b018b67c` changed file-scoped canonical entity upserts from `SET n += row.props` to explicit base-property assignments while preserving map fallback for metadata-bearing rows; focused tests, `go test ./cmd/ingester ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1`, `go vet ./cmd/ingester ./internal/storage/neo4j`, `git diff --check`, and NornicDB hot-path tests passed. Remote rebuilt binaries before runtime proof. The one-large API/PHP A/B `pcg-reducer-api-explicit-sets-b018-20260429T1430Z` drained healthy but regressed wall `107s` to `114s`, canonical entity phase `28.041s` to `35.517s`, canonical phase-group write `~28s` to `37.066s`, and `Variable` label time `22.549s` to `25.929s` for the same `103908` rows; CPU idle stayed `81.38%`, IO wait `0.88%`, and disk idle `89.59%`. Commit `b3215bf7` reverted the code slice and re-ran `go test ./cmd/ingester ./internal/storage/neo4j -count=1` plus `git diff --check`. | Keep the original map-property row shape. Do not pursue PCG-side explicit SET routing as a reducer throughput win without new NornicDB evidence. |
| Conflict matrix | Planned | Current conflict routing is safe but coarse | Map true conflict unit per reducer domain |
| Shared runner partitioning | Planned | Code-call and repo-dependency lanes still have global behavior | Partition by acceptance unit or repo scope |
| Cypher/index pilot | Planned | SQL and semantic paths show broad anchors and scan risk | Start with SQL relationship materialization |
| NornicDB backend proof | In progress | NornicDB runtime-branch commit `9369a40` proves the no-return `UNWIND MATCH MATCH MERGE rel SET rel...` code-call shape has a batch-chain contract; 512-row local microbench improved from `2260916375 ns/op` fallback to `1386075 ns/op` patched, but the combined PCG routing proof regressed single-large wall to `193s` with `15.648s` code-call write time. PCG commit `88f2684f` adds shared edge write-shape logs. Run `pcg-reducer-websites-write-shape-20260429T0156Z` at `97a2ff61` drained healthy in `188s`; shape logs showed one code-call route, zero skipped rows, `25` grouped writes, `24,583` rows, and rising full-batch durations from `0.369s` to about `0.84s`. NornicDB commit `824c990` then bulk-created new relationships inside that chain-batch path; local 5k Badger benchmark improved `657270417 ns/op` to `595086583 ns/op`, and remote run `pcg-reducer-websites-bulk-rel-20260429T021749Z` kept wall at `188s` while lowering code-call graph write `15.770s` to `14.247s` and summed batch duration `15.730s` to `14.209s`. NornicDB `7017ee2` removed ready-index miss legacy scans and showed a strong high-fanout storage benchmark (`6063200 ns/op` to `1880 ns/op`), but `pcg-reducer-websites-ready-miss-20260429T023832Z` stayed flat at `188s` with code-call write `14.320s`. Retesting PCG exact-label code-call routing at `972a7202` after both NornicDB fixes regressed the same proof to `200s` and `15.328s` write time, so `1f8dbe45` reverted it again. NornicDB `2dd6d27` adds opt-in per-batch chain profiling and the remote profiled run drained healthy at baseline `188s`; artifact aggregation found relationship lookup dominated baseline chain time (`4.475s` of `7.271s`), two wrapper fixes did not move PCG, and NornicDB `07b792b` finally routed the transaction-layer typed lookup, lowering the same proof to `184s` wall with code-call write `10.064s` and relationship lookup `0.162s`. | Keep PCG exact-label routing reverted; next NornicDB work should not assume existence-check scans or broad code-entity labels are the PCG bottleneck without trace evidence. Shift next NornicDB/reducer work to the remaining mixed-corpus queue/readiness tail; do not scale workers from this handler-only win |
| Concurrency proof | Planned | `8` workers completed healthy but too slowly | Test `16` workers only after telemetry and conflict fixes |
| Full-corpus acceptance | In progress | Baseline `7h43m40s` was unacceptable. Current rebuilt full-corpus proof `pcg-reducer-full-after-disk-clean-815-20260429T194528Z` drained healthy in `931s` with projector `896/896`, reducer `8284/8284`, `code_calls 118564/118564`, `repo_dependency 2057/2057`, and no failed/dead-lettered work. Resource summary still showed headroom (`cpu_idle_avg=42.16%`, `io_wait_avg=2.65%`, `disk_idle_avg=81.29%`). Follow-up NornicDB Compose full-corpus run `pcg-nornicdb-fullcorpus-20260430T131736Z-f0002d52` rebuilt all Linux binaries and left API/MCP/NornicDB/Postgres/reducer running for read validation. Queue drain reached `947` active generations and `8023` succeeded work items at about `1800s`; bootstrap reported projection completion at `1848.679s`. API and MCP health were green, both API and MCP `/api/v0/index-status` returned `healthy` with queue `succeeded=8023`, MCP JSON-RPC `initialize` and `tools/list` returned successfully with `39` tools, and read-only Cypher through the API returned graph counts matching persisted relationship truth (`Repository=947`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=1`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=4`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=46`, `USES_MODULE=61`). Resource samples averaged `33.47%` CPU idle, `0.00%` IO wait, and `16.13%` disk utilization. Reducer handler sums were no longer the wall-clock bottleneck: workload materialization `1019` items / `97.488s` handler sum / `3.492s` max, deployment mapping `947` items / `39.677s` sum / `3.087s` max, SQL relationship materialization `947` items / `47.772s` sum / `3.332s` max, and semantic entity materialization `375` items / `116.500s` sum / `21.345s` max. However this run is not a clean acceptance proof: bootstrap logged `959` projection terminal events for `947` unique generations, including `6` generations projected more than once and `2` duplicate generations with late failures. The terminal bootstrap error was a NornicDB unique constraint violation from a duplicate canonical entity write after an earlier successful projection, with sibling duplicate writes canceled. | The reducer target is effectively under the 2-hour goal, but full-corpus acceptance remains blocked by a correctness bug in bootstrap/source-local duplicate generation admission or deduplication. Fix duplicate projection before using the `30m` wall-clock result as release evidence. Do not tune worker counts from this run; the remaining proven risk is duplicate source-local graph writes, not reducer queue throughput. |
| Clean full-corpus 9eadddcc proof | Proven, next optimization identified | Fresh rebuilt NornicDB full-corpus proof `pcg-full-9eadddcc-20260430T223312Z` used commit `9eadddcc`, real repo copies, and rebuilt Linux binaries for `pcg`, `pcg-api`, `pcg-ingester`, `pcg-reducer`, and `pcg-mcp-server`. The run reached healthy from first local progress at `2026-04-30T22:33:15Z` to queue-empty at `2026-04-30T22:51:33Z` (`18m18s`), with projector `878/878`, reducer `7568/7568`, queue `0`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Resource samples were backend/CPU-active but not disk-bound: `cpu_idle_avg=21.38%`, `io_wait_avg=0.82%`, `disk_idle_avg=85.89%`. Temporary read services were started against the same graph after drain; API `/health` and MCP `/health` returned OK, API `/api/v0/repositories` returned `878` repositories, and `/api/v0/index-status` returned healthy with queue `succeeded=8446`. Reducer handler sums were dominated by `workload_materialization` (`1932` items, `4170.848s` handler sum, `100.645s` max handler, `349296.837s` queue-wait sum), followed by `semantic_entity_materialization` (`368` items, `668.040s` handler sum, `129.512s` max), `deployment_mapping` (`1742` items, `227.843s` handler sum), and much smaller code-call/deployable/inheritance/SQL/workload-identity sums. Inner-stage aggregation explains the workload long pole: `dependency_retract_duration_seconds=3312.891s` while `dependency_write_duration_seconds=0.000s`, with `graph_write_duration_seconds=348.986s`, `load_inputs_duration_seconds=69.372s`, and `129` workload rows / `21` instance rows / `972` endpoint rows written. Deployment mapping did not show the same profile: `226.787s` total, `132.558s` infrastructure graph write, `70.379s` fact load, and only `0.863s` workload replay. Semantic retries still saw retryable 30s graph write timeouts, but all cleared and no semantic work dead-lettered. | Classification: wall-clock and correctness proof for the current full-corpus reducer stack, plus a new handler-win target. Next code slice should TDD a correctness-preserving workload dependency-retract skip/narrowing rule analogous to the repo-dependency additive skip: keep retracts for stale contributors and explicit destructive actions, but avoid broad dependency retract when the current accepted workload projection has no dependency rows and no prior/stale truth requiring deletion. Do not increase reducer worker defaults from this result. |
| Workload dependency empty-retract skip | Proven full-corpus wall-clock win | Commit `4c215dd2` adds a correctness-preserving workload dependency retract guard. Instead of issuing broad `Workload DEPENDS_ON` retracts for every current repo, the reconciler first checks whether matching workload dependency edges already exist for the current repo/evidence source and only returns retract rows for repos that actually have graph truth to remove. TDD covers no-existing/no-retract, existing-edge/retract, write-without-retract on first workload dependency projection, ambiguous current rows still retracting existing edges, and the NornicDB read query shape used by reducer wiring. Verification passed locally and remotely with `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer -count=1`, plus `git diff --check` and prohibited-term scan. Remote focused A/B used the same 20-repo workload-retract hot slice and rebuilt binaries before each run. Pre-change `9eadddcc` drained healthy from `2026-04-30T23:11:28Z` to `2026-04-30T23:11:37Z`, with projector `20/20`, reducer `152/152`, workload materialization `22` items / `4.332s` handler sum / `0.295s` max, `dependency_retract_duration_seconds=2.222s`, `dependency_retract_row_count=22`, and `dependency_write_duration_seconds=0`. Post-change `4c215dd2` drained healthy from `2026-04-30T23:09:15Z` to `2026-04-30T23:09:24Z`, with projector `20/20`, reducer `152/152`, workload materialization `22` items / `1.037s` handler sum / `0.140s` max, `dependency_retract_duration_seconds=0`, `dependency_retract_row_count=0`, and `dependency_write_duration_seconds=0`. Fresh full-corpus proof `pcg-full-current-20260501T092039Z` on commit `8b585d9a` rebuilt the remote Linux binaries before launch and drained cleanly: stable terminal from `2026-05-01T09:20:39Z` to `2026-05-01T09:31:49Z` was `670s` (`11m10s`), first queued work to terminal was `652s`, and first queue-empty was observed at `2026-05-01T09:31:04Z`. Final queue was healthy with projector `878/878`, reducer `7568/7568`, total work `8446/8446`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Workload dependency retract stayed eliminated at full-corpus scale: `dependency_retract_duration_seconds=0`, `dependency_retract_row_count=0`, while workload materialization wrote the same expected shape (`129` workload rows, `21` instance rows, `972` endpoint rows). Workload materialization handler sum dropped from the preceding clean full proof's `4170.848s` to `596.993s`; semantic handler sum dropped from `668.040s` to `154.215s`; deployment mapping was `96.832s`. Resource averages were `cpu_idle_avg=45.30%`, `io_wait_avg=3.11%`, and `disk_idle_avg=59.88%`, with brief CPU-active periods rather than an idle reducer tail. API and MCP were left running against the same graph. Corrected NornicDB read validation passed through the live API after setting the database to `nornic`: `/healthz` OK for API and MCP, `/api/v0/repositories` returned `878` repositories, read-only Cypher returned `Repository=878`, and repository edge counts were `DEPENDS_ON=58`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=233`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=71`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=471`, and `USES_MODULE=218`. | Classification: full-corpus wall-clock win and correctness proof for the workload dependency retract guard. The reducer is now well below the 2-hour target on this corpus; the next work should validate richer API/MCP query surfaces and then target remaining overlapped source-local/shared write shape only with telemetry-backed hypotheses. Do not increase reducer worker defaults from this result. |
| Full-corpus e06c47d6 acceptance and read validation | Proven | Fresh rebuilt full-corpus proof `pcg-full-current-20260501T124752Z` used commit `e06c47d6` after rebuilding the remote Linux binaries for `pcg`, `pcg-api`, `pcg-mcp-server`, `pcg-ingester`, and `pcg-reducer`. The run reached stable terminal from `2026-05-01T12:47:53Z` to `2026-05-01T12:59:05Z` (`672s`, `11m12s`), with first queued work to terminal `653s` and source-local done to terminal `637s`. Final queue was healthy with projector `878/878`, reducer `7568/7568`, total work `8446/8446`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Resource samples averaged `cpu_idle_avg=51.02%`, `io_wait_avg=2.09%`, and `disk_idle_avg=66.32%`. Reducer handler sums were workload materialization `570.258s` (`10.946s` max), semantic entity materialization `147.349s` (`37.977s` max), deployment mapping `93.517s`, code-call materialization `63.794s`, inheritance `56.071s`, SQL `50.945s`, deployable-unit `46.648s`, and workload identity `7.607s`. Workload inner-stage metrics showed dependency retract stayed eliminated (`dependency_retract_duration_seconds=0`, `dependency_retract_row_count=0`), while `dependency_reconcile_duration_seconds=490.278s`, `load_inputs_duration_seconds=70.637s`, and graph writes totaled `2.391s`. Read validation restarted only API/MCP with `DEFAULT_DATABASE=nornic`; `/healthz` passed, `/api/v0/repositories` returned `878`, `/api/v0/index-status` returned queue `8446/8446`, and raw Cypher through `/api/v0/code/cypher` returned repository edge counts `CONTAINS=2581`, `DEFINES=50`, `DEPENDS_ON=58`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=233`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=71`, plus endpoint graph rows with OpenAPI/framework evidence. Full-corpus `iac_reachability_rows` were `0` because this local-host path does not currently run bootstrap-only IaC reachability finalization; bounded `/api/v0/iac/dead` over the 878 repo scope therefore returned `analysis_status=derived_candidate_analysis` in `3s`, while materialized dead-IaC truth remains proven by `pcg-dead-iac-compose-20260501`. | Classification: clean full-corpus wall-clock/read-surface proof plus a product-truth gap. Next slice should wire IaC reachability finalization into local-host/full-corpus completion or add an explicit admin/finalization path before claiming full-corpus materialized dead-IaC rows. Keep API/MCP/graph stack running for interactive validation. |
| Local-host IaC finalization and read-surface validation | Proven with follow-up read gap | Commit `2f75bc3a` adds a one-shot `local_authoritative` IaC reachability finalizer. It reuses the same drain predicate as deferred content indexes, waits for all discovered projectors plus shared projection work to succeed, and then materializes `iac_reachability_rows` before exiting. Local verification passed `go test ./cmd/pcg ./internal/storage/postgres ./internal/iacreachability ./internal/query -count=1`, `git diff --check`, prohibited-term scan, and `mkdocs build --strict`. Remote proof `local-iac-finalizer-20260501T133332Z` pulled `2f75bc3a`, rebuilt Linux binaries, copied the generic dead-IaC fixture repos as real Git repos, and drained healthy in `12s`: projector `10/10`, reducer `77/77`, queue `87/87`, and `18` materialized reachability rows (`used=8`, `unused=5`, `ambiguous=5`) across Terraform, Helm, Ansible, Kustomize, and Docker Compose. API returned `truth_basis=materialized_reducer_rows`, `analysis_status=materialized_reachability`, and `findings_count=10`; raw graph nodes, graph relationships, deployment evidence, and reachability rows were captured under that run. The full-corpus read stack was restarted against the existing graph with `PCG_QUERY_PROFILE=local_full_stack`: `/healthz` passed for API and MCP, `/api/v0/repositories/{repo}/story` and `/api/v0/repositories/{repo}/context` returned, and MCP `tools/list` returned `40` tools. Service context and deployment trace for a representative service each exceeded a `20s` client-side observation window without bytes, so those are a graph-backed read query-shape gap, not a reducer drain blocker. | Reducer classification remains: do not tune worker defaults. The next reducer-only hypothesis is workload dependency reconcile (`490.278s` of the latest full proof) because retract is already `0`, graph writes were only `2.391s`, and input load was `70.637s`. Separately, profile/read-surface work should bound and optimize service context/deployment trace query shapes before using those routes as full-corpus acceptance gates. |
| Full-corpus 71cb002b finalizer proof | Proven | Fresh rebuilt full-corpus proof `pcg-full-finalizer-20260501T134928Z` used commit `71cb002b` after rebuilding remote Linux binaries for `pcg`, `pcg-api`, `pcg-mcp-server`, `pcg-ingester`, and `pcg-reducer`. The corrected run started at `2026-05-01T13:52:13Z` and reached terminal validation at `2026-05-01T14:03:03Z` (`650s`, `10m50s`), with queue `8446/8446`, projector `878/878`, reducer `7568/7568`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Resource samples averaged `cpu_idle_avg=40.35%`, `io_wait_avg=3.17%`, and `disk_idle_avg=95.62%`. The local-host IaC finalizer ran after queue drain and materialized `803` durable reachability rows: Ansible unused `413`; Compose ambiguous `7` and unused `46`; Terraform used `51`, ambiguous `13`, and unused `273`. API/MCP were restarted against the fresh graph with `PCG_QUERY_PROFILE=local_full_stack`; `/healthz` passed for both, `/api/v0/index-status` returned healthy queue `8446/8446`, MCP `tools/list` returned `40` tools, raw repository edge counts matched the previous proof (`DEPENDS_ON=58`, `DEPLOYS_FROM=233`, `DISCOVERS_CONFIG_IN=71`, `PROVISIONS_DEPENDENCY_FOR=471`, `USES_MODULE=218`), and `/api/v0/iac/dead` used `truth_basis=materialized_reducer_rows` with `analysis_status=materialized_reachability` over the persisted scope. | Classification: correctness proof for full-corpus materialized dead-IaC on the local-host path plus slight wall-clock parity/improvement versus the preceding `672s` run. Keep the stack running for read validation. Next reducer target remains workload dependency reconcile/data shape rather than workers, because the final queue is healthy and the last detailed reducer metrics showed retract eliminated and graph writes small. |
| Dead-IaC paged materialized reads | Proven | Commit `d9eedbab` fixes the full-corpus read-surface gap exposed by run `pcg-full-finalizer-20260501T134928Z`: `/api/v0/iac/dead` still preserves the operator-safe `limit` cap but now reports `total_findings_count`, `offset`, `truncated`, and `next_offset`, and MCP `find_dead_iac` can pass `offset`. This prevents a materialized corpus with `803` reachability rows from looking like it only has the first `500` returned findings. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/query ./internal/mcp ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. Remote smoke against the still-running full-corpus stack after rebuilding API/MCP at `8e2de2ba` returned page `0` as `findings_count=500`, `total_findings_count=752`, `truncated=true`, `next_offset=500`, and page `500` as `findings_count=252`, `total_findings_count=752`, `truncated=false`, both with `truth_basis=materialized_reducer_rows` and `analysis_status=materialized_reachability`. The total is `752` cleanup findings because the durable `803` rows include `51` `used` rows that are intentionally omitted from cleanup output. | Correctness/read-surface win. Keep the response cap, use paging for full-corpus review, and continue reducer/read-shape work from measured bottlenecks. |
| Workload dependency read-shape reduction | Implemented locally | Commit `8e2de2ba` targets the latest measured `dependency_reconcile_duration_seconds=490.278s` where graph writes were only `2.391s` and dependency retract was already zero. This slice changes the repo-dependency lookup from one broad `source.id IN $repo_ids OR target.id IN $repo_ids` scan into outgoing and incoming branches anchored by `Repository.id`, and narrows the existing workload-dependency retract probe to return only distinct source `repo_id` values because the reconciler only uses repository ownership. It also removes an avoidable graph entry-point traversal from service/workload context fetches because enrichment immediately omits the `entry_points` field. Local TDD first failed on the broad `OR` query and unnecessary entry-point query, then passed with `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/query -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. | Push, pull/rebuild on the remote host, then run a focused reducer proof to see whether `dependency_reconcile_duration_seconds` moves before making broader bulk-lookup or worker-count changes. |
| Graph-first service evidence read path | Correctness win, not wall-clock proven | Commit `0259b200`: service context on the fresh full-corpus stack still exceeded a `45s` client observation window after the entry-point traversal was removed, so the next read hypothesis targeted redundant content hydration. This slice keeps graph-backed `deployment_evidence` as the authoritative service/trace summary when it already exists and skips the expensive content fallback in that case; the fallback still runs when graph evidence is absent. Local TDD first failed because `loadServiceDeploymentEvidence` called `ListRepoFiles` despite graph evidence already being present, then passed with `go test ./internal/query -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. Corrected remote smoke after rebuilding and restarting API/MCP at `4ea0ceb3` still timed out a representative full-corpus service context at `45s`, so this is retained as a correctness/data-shape cleanup, not a latency win. | Add stage timing around `loadServiceQueryEvidence`, `loadConsumerRepositoryEnrichmentWithLimit`, and `loadProvisioningSourceChainsWithLimit` before changing response defaults. |
| Workload-context query anchor reduction | Correctness win, not wall-clock proven | Commit `245e0d20`: full-corpus service context and direct-only deployment trace still exceeded `45s` after graph-first deployment evidence, so the next proven hot-shape hypothesis is the repeated workload lookup anchor. This slice keeps the flexible `w.name = $service_name OR w.id = $service_name` lookup only for the first service resolution, then re-anchors repository, instance, and platform follow-up reads by the resolved `w.id = $workload_id`. Local TDD first failed because follow-up queries still carried the broad service-name `OR`, then passed with `go test ./internal/query -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. Corrected remote smoke after rebuilding and restarting API/MCP at `4ea0ceb3` still timed out both the representative full-corpus service context and direct-only deployment trace at `45s`. | Do not claim a wall-clock win from this slice. Next step is evidence-first read-stage timing, not another speculative query rewrite. |
| Service read-stage timing | Diagnostic win | Commit `4cee86fe` wires stage timing logs through API and MCP entity/impact handlers for service context, service story, workload context, workload story, and deployment trace reads. The logs report bounded start/completion events with `operation`, `stage`, `target_service`, `repo_id`, duration, row counts, and result flags so a client timeout can still show the last completed graph/content stage. Local verification passed `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query -count=1` and `git diff --check`. Remote rebuild/restart against full-corpus run `pcg-full-finalizer-20260501T134928Z` showed both representative service context and direct-only deployment trace timed out at `90s`; the new evidence narrowed the first blocker to `repository_lookup`, which took about `97.060s` before the request moved on. | Diagnostic proof accepted. Use these logs to drive read-shape changes only; do not treat read API latency as reducer queue throughput. |
| Service read anchor and instance-index proof | Focused wall-clock read win | Commit `8ae4dd98` removes the service-name/workload-id `OR` from service resolution by trying exact service name first and exact workload id second, then resolves repository name through the `Workload.repo_id` property instead of a hot `Repository-[:DEFINES]->Workload` traversal. Local TDD first failed on the broad lookup and passed with the focused query tests plus `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query -count=1`. Remote restart on the existing full-corpus graph moved `repository_lookup` from about `97.060s` to about `0.004s`, exposing `instance_lookup` as the next timeout stage. Commit `c93b6c90` adds `WorkloadInstance.workload_id` and `repo_id` performance indexes, reshapes instance/platform reads through `i.workload_id = $workload_id`, and renames timing metadata to `target_service` so API process metadata no longer overwrites the target in JSON logs. Local verification passed `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query ./internal/graph -count=1` and `git diff --check`. Fresh remote focused proof `pcg-focused-read-index-c93b6c90-20260501T163016Z` used six real copied repos, rebuilt binaries first, applied graph schema from scratch, drained healthy in `35s` (`6/6` projector, `48/48` reducer, `0` failed/dead-lettered), and then served the same representative service context in `0.756s` and direct-only deployment trace in `0.141s`. Stage timings showed `workload_lookup <= 0.001s`, `repository_lookup <= 0.001s`, `instance_lookup <= 0.001s`, `repo_infrastructure` as the largest remaining context stage at `0.354s`, CPU idle average `29.67%`, IO wait `0%`, and disk idle `94.83%`. | Read-surface wall-clock win on a fresh schema-focused corpus, not a reducer worker/concurrency claim. To apply this to the full-corpus read stack, run a fresh full-corpus graph so the new indexes are present; the currently running full-corpus graph predates `c93b6c90`. The next measured read target is bounded infrastructure hydration, while reducer throughput remains under the 2-hour full-corpus goal from prior clean proofs. |
| Full-corpus indexed read proof | Proven | Fresh rebuilt full-corpus proof `pcg-full-indexed-read-d1c60fc5-20260501T164905Z` used commit `d1c60fc5` after stopping the stale pre-index stack, cleaning generated run artifacts to recover disk space, and rebuilding Linux binaries for `pcg`, `pcg-api`, `pcg-mcp-server`, `pcg-ingester`, and `pcg-reducer`. An initial attempt at `2026-05-01T16:40:03Z` was invalidated by remote disk exhaustion (`No space left on device`) and is excluded from the performance result. The corrected run started at `2026-05-01T16:49:05Z`, reached source-local completion at `2026-05-01T16:58:45Z`, and reached terminal validation at `2026-05-01T16:59:45Z` (`640s`, `10m40s`; first queue to terminal `621s`; source-local done to terminal `60s`). Final queue was healthy with projector `878/878`, reducer `7568/7568`, total work `8446/8446`, and `0` failed/dead-lettered items. Resource samples averaged `cpu_idle_avg=41.74%`, `io_wait_avg=2.74%`, and `disk_idle_avg=57.25%`. Workload materialization remained healthy and much lower than the older pre-retract baseline: `1932` items, `188.363s` handler sum, `6.525s` max handler, `dependency_reconcile_duration_seconds=102.853s`, `dependency_retract_duration_seconds=0`, `graph_write_duration_seconds=3.168s`, `load_inputs_duration_seconds=73.926s`, `129` workload rows, `21` instance rows, and `972` endpoint rows. Reducer handler sums were code-call `64.150s`, deployable-unit `46.561s`, deployment mapping `96.111s`, inheritance `55.316s`, semantic entity `158.284s`, SQL `49.349s`, workload identity `7.727s`, and workload materialization `188.363s`. API and MCP were left running on the fresh graph: `/healthz` passed for both, `/api/v0/index-status` returned queue `8446/8446`, `/api/v0/repositories` returned `878`, and MCP `tools/list` returned `40` tools. The representative service context that previously timed out now returned in `16.592s`, and direct deployment trace returned in `1.402s`. Stage timings show the original blockers are fixed at full-corpus scale: `workload_lookup=0.002s`, `repository_lookup=0.003s`, `instance_lookup=0.001s`; remaining service-context cost is now `consumer_repository_enrichment=10.319s`, `graph_deployment_evidence=4.215s`, `framework_routes=1.325s`, and `repo_infrastructure=0.518s`. | Classification: full-corpus wall-clock/read-surface proof. Reducer throughput remains well below the 2-hour goal, and the new indexes/read anchors remove the prior 90s service-read timeout. The next read optimization should target bounded consumer repository enrichment and deployment evidence query shape; do not increase reducer worker defaults from this result. |
| Anchored incoming deployment-evidence read | Rejected hypothesis | Commit `8a950023` tried to make the incoming `EvidenceArtifact` deployment-evidence read look more selectively anchored by starting from `MATCH (r:Repository {id: $repo_id})` before traversing back to source repositories. Local TDD passed with `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan. Remote rebuild/restart of API/MCP against full-corpus run `pcg-full-indexed-read-d1c60fc5-20260501T164905Z` proved the exact NornicDB shape regressed badly: representative service context moved from `16.592s` to `49.225s`, and `graph_deployment_evidence` moved from `4.215s` to `36.881s` while `consumer_repository_enrichment` stayed about `10.399s`. | Reverted in the same follow-up slice. Do not reintroduce this reverse anchored shape for NornicDB; the next optimization should target either the existing working deployment-evidence shape with narrower payload/limits or the proven larger `consumer_repository_enrichment` content-search cost. |
| Framework route fact index | Wall-clock read win | Current slice adds `fact_records_framework_routes_repo_path_idx`, a partial expression index on `payload->>'repo_id'` and `payload->>'relative_path'` for file facts that actually carry `parsed_file_data.framework_semantics`. The remote `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` before the index showed `ListFrameworkRoutes` scanning `fact_records` via `fact_records_scope_generation_idx` on `fact_kind='file'`, removing `43813` rows per worker and reading `131109` buffers for about `1289ms`. Applying the index to the running full-corpus Postgres changed the same query to an index scan with `Execution Time: 0.072ms`. After restarting API/MCP on reverted commit `d63892c3`, representative service context improved from the prior clean `16.592s` to `13.355s`; the `framework_routes` stage moved from `1.325s` to `0.001s`, `graph_deployment_evidence` was back to `2.232s` after reverting the failed Cypher shape, and `consumer_repository_enrichment` remained the largest stage at `10.547s`. | Keep this index. The next optimization is not another reducer worker change: it is the repeated Postgres trigram content search in `consumer_repository_enrichment`, which currently does one service-name search plus hostname searches across `content_files`. |
| Hostname false-positive filter | Correctness cleanup, no latency win | Current slice tightens service hostname extraction so config/code dotted identifiers ending in `endpoint`, `env`, `host`, or `hostname` are not treated as public service entrypoints or fed into cross-repo consumer evidence searches. Local TDD first failed on config-identifier hostnames and then passed after expanding the false-positive TLD blocklist. Remote proof applied the uncommitted patch to the full-corpus API/MCP checkout before committing: observed hostname count for the representative service dropped from `13` to `6`, but service-context wall time did not improve (`13.355s` before, `13.652s` after), and `consumer_repository_enrichment` remained the dominant stage at `10.976s`. | Keep only as a query-truth cleanup; do not count it as a performance win. The next performance design needs a different data shape for consumer references rather than more hostname filtering. |
| Exact-case hostname content search | Wall-clock read win | Commit `65637908` keeps service-name consumer searches case-insensitive but routes normalized hostname searches through a new exact-case `LIKE` content-store method. Remote `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on the full-corpus Postgres showed every hostname search still used `content_files_content_trgm_idx`, but `LIKE` reduced individual hostname search execution from about `1.2-2.8s` with `ILIKE` to about `0.29-0.76s`. The uncommitted patch was applied to the remote checkout before commit, API/MCP were rebuilt and restarted, and the representative service context improved to `7.010s`; `consumer_repository_enrichment` dropped from `10.976s` after hostname filtering to `4.184s` with exact-case hostname search while preserving the same `12` consumer rows. | Keep this narrow backend read optimization. The next remaining read costs are NornicDB `graph_deployment_evidence` around `2.28s` and Go/entity shaping in `repo_infrastructure` around `0.42s`; direct remote NornicDB timing must precede any future Cypher shape commit. |
| Incoming deployment-evidence graph read shape | Wall-clock read win | Commit `cb61e51d` changes the incoming graph evidence read to first match `(artifact:EvidenceArtifact)-[:EVIDENCES_REPOSITORY_RELATIONSHIP]->(r:Repository {id: $repo_id})`, then cross a `WITH artifact, r` boundary before matching the source repository. Direct remote NornicDB proof on the full-corpus graph showed why the boundary matters: the old source-first incoming count took about `2.268s`, the artifact-target count took `0.046s`, the artifact-target plus `WITH` source count took `0.153s`, and the same full returned column shape took `0.175s` for `534` incoming artifact rows. The logically equivalent shape without `WITH` hit the API's `30s` read cap, matching the earlier rejected reverse-anchor lesson. After applying the uncommitted patch to the remote checkout and rebuilding API/MCP, the representative service context returned in `5.682s`; `graph_deployment_evidence` dropped to `0.121s`, while `consumer_repository_enrichment` remained the largest stage at `3.993s`. | Keep this Cypher shape. Do not reintroduce the earlier reverse repository-anchor shape. The next read target is the remaining content-search/data-shape cost in consumer repository enrichment; reducer worker defaults stay unchanged. |
| Parallel bounded consumer content searches | Wall-clock read win | Commit `8e3dd362` keeps the same one service-name plus up to four hostname search contract but executes those independent Postgres content searches concurrently and merges per-repo evidence after all searches finish. Remote term-level proof on the full-corpus Postgres showed the old stage was additive: service-name `ILIKE` took `1.945s`, while the four bounded hostname `LIKE` searches took `0.761s`, `0.509s`, `0.279s`, and `0.584s`. Local TDD first failed under sequential execution by blocking the first search and proving the hostname searches had not started, then passed after the bounded parallel fan-out. Remote proof applied the uncommitted patch, rebuilt API/MCP, and restarted only read services against the full-corpus stores: representative service context moved from `5.682s` to `3.693s`, `consumer_repository_enrichment` moved from `3.993s` to `1.901s`, and the response preserved `19` consumer rows and `17` deployment evidence artifacts. A warm repeat returned in `2.222s` with `consumer_repository_enrichment=1.891s`, confirming the remaining stable long pole is the slowest service-name content search rather than the graph read. | Keep this bounded concurrency because it preserves result shape and does not change reducer worker defaults. The next potential read win needs a materialized consumer-reference data shape or narrower service-name search; do not keep shaving graph reads that are already sub-millisecond warm. |
| Exact-case lower-case service content search | Wall-clock read win | Commit `951c4c55` extends exact-case content search from normalized hostnames to lower-case service tokens while preserving case-insensitive search for mixed-case service tokens. Remote pre-change proof on an eight-service sample showed identical first-25 row sets between `ILIKE` and `LIKE` (`diff_count=0`, no empty `LIKE` results) while aggregate query time moved from `14.151s` to `3.667s`; a representative single service moved from `1930.795ms` to `487.546ms` with the same `25` rows. After applying the patch, rebuilding API/MCP, and restarting read services against full-corpus run `pcg-full-indexed-read-d1c60fc5-20260501T164905Z`, representative service context moved from `3.693s` to `2.377s`, `consumer_repository_enrichment` moved from `1.901s` to `0.760s`, and the response preserved `19` consumer rows and `17` deployment evidence artifacts. Local verification passed focused consumer-search tests, `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched Go files. | Keep the conditional exact-case path because it is measured and result-preserving for normalized lower-case tokens. The next measured read target is `repo_infrastructure` and any durable consumer-reference materialization; do not count this as reducer worker throughput or use it to justify higher reducer concurrency. |
| Service-owned hostname consumer search budget | Correctness/read-shape cleanup with marginal latency | Commit `34364806` changes the bounded hostname budget for query-time consumer evidence so service-affine hostnames are searched before unrelated external hostnames. The fallback preserves the old first-four bounded behavior when no hostname matches a distinctive service token, so opaque or vanity domains still receive bounded evidence. TDD first failed on the new service-affinity selector and then passed; local verification passed `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. Remote proof rebuilt API/MCP against full-corpus run `pcg-full-indexed-read-d1c60fc5-20260501T164905Z`: the same representative service context moved from `2.36s`, `1.10s`, `1.10s` to `2.25s`, `1.02s`, `1.02s`; warm `consumer_repository_enrichment` moved from about `0.744s` to about `0.68s`. The response grew slightly (`945648` to `950426` bytes) because service-owned hostname evidence returned `25` consumer rows instead of the prior `19`. | Keep as a precision/read-shape cleanup, not as a major performance claim. The next real latency target is a materialized or indexed consumer-reference data shape so API/MCP do not repeatedly run raw trigram content searches for the same service story. |
| Indexed hostname content references | Wall-clock read win, data-shape win | Commit `003186d0` adds a generic `content_file_references` Postgres lookup table, materializes normalized hostname references during content writes, and has consumer enrichment prefer indexed hostname equality lookups with old-schema/partial-index fallback to the existing content search. Local TDD first failed on missing schema, missing content-writer materialization, and missing indexed query use, then passed. Remote proof applied the patch to full-corpus run `pcg-full-indexed-read-d1c60fc5-20260501T164905Z`, rebuilt API/MCP and runtime binaries, applied the schema, and proof-backfilled the already-running corpus (`131413` content files, `323607` hostname references, `1m52.539s`; future fresh runs populate this table during content projection). The representative service context returned in `1.155s`, `0.555s`, and `0.552s`, with `consumer_repository_enrichment` at `0.448s`, `0.432s`, and `0.433s` for `15` consumer rows. Direct Postgres proof showed the indexed hostname lookup using `content_file_references_lookup_idx` plus `content_files_repo_path_idx` at `0.249ms`, while the old `content LIKE` trigram body search for the same hostname took `761.188ms`. The remaining warm consumer-enrichment cost is now mostly the exact-case service-name body search, measured at `418.173ms` for the same representative request. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/contentrefs ./internal/storage/postgres ./internal/query -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/query ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched Go/schema files. | Keep the indexed hostname-reference data shape. This is a read-path optimization over the full-corpus graph, not a reducer worker-concurrency claim. The next read target is a materialized or indexed service-name/reference path, because hostname body scans are no longer the dominant consumer-enrichment cost. |
| Indexed service-name content references | Wall-clock read win, data-shape win | Commit `d0d584ad` extends `content_file_references` to lower-case, service-like hyphenated names and routes lower-case service-name consumer evidence through the same indexed lookup with fallback to the prior exact-case body search when no indexed rows exist. The first remote proof was intentionally rejected as too broad: indexing all two-segment hyphen tokens produced `1727588` service-name rows and top values were mostly CSS/HTML/config tokens. The retained extractor requires service-context lines and at least three hyphen segments, reducing the full-corpus proof table to `240154` service-name rows while preserving the representative consumer rows. Remote proof on full-corpus run `pcg-full-indexed-read-d1c60fc5-20260501T164905Z` rebuilt API/MCP, proof-backfilled the running content store, and returned the representative service context in `0.605s`, `0.131s`, and `0.132s`; `consumer_repository_enrichment` moved to `0.012s`, `0.009s`, and `0.009s` for `15` consumer rows. Direct Postgres proof showed the indexed service-name lookup using `content_file_references_lookup_idx` plus `content_files_repo_path_idx` at `0.224ms`, while the previous exact-case body search for the same service token was about `455.840ms`. Local verification passed `go test ./cmd/api ./cmd/mcp-server ./internal/contentrefs ./internal/query ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched Go files. | Keep the stricter service-name reference index. Treat this as a read-path data-shape win, not a reducer concurrency claim. Future broadening must be evidence-first because the rejected extractor proved token indexes can become noisy quickly. |
| Dead-IaC fixture ownership cleanup | Implemented locally | The dead-IaC family audit confirmed Terraform, Helm, Kustomize, Ansible, and Docker Compose are the owned cleanup families today; Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD are currently evidence/root sources, while SQL deadness needs a separate product contract. This slice removes manifest drift by promoting `iac_quality.dead_iac` from planned to an owned product-truth suite wired to `scripts/verify_dead_iac_compose.sh`, while keeping unsupported SQL/Jenkins/GitHub Actions deadness out of the claim. Local verification passed `./scripts/verify_product_truth_fixtures.sh`. | Keep future family expansion TDD-first: structured Jenkins/GHA roots into existing families, ArgoCD multi-source/value-file nuance, then a separate SQL deadness contract only after the product semantics are explicit. |
| Grouped Terraform variable fallback writes | Focused wall-clock source-local win | Commit `5aeef28d` preserves the singleton Cypher shape required for brace-bearing Terraform variable metadata while allowing those fallback statements to remain inside same-label NornicDB phase groups. The pre-change concurrent six-repo proof was stopped after about `2m13s` because four source-local projectors were contending on hundreds of TerraformVariable singleton executions; one already-complete repo showed `3563` TerraformVariable rows across `757` executions and `117.580s` total label duration. The serial diagnostic `aws-terraform-heavy6-batched-serial-20260501T230738Z` drained healthy in about `8m31s` with projector `6/6`, reducer `48/48`, and no failed/dead-lettered items, proving the fallback shape was correct but execution-heavy. The retained patch changed the same focused concurrent proof `aws-terraform-heavy6-grouped-fallback-concurrent-20260501T232135Z` to drain healthy with projector `6/6`, reducer `48/48`, no failed/dead-lettered items, and owner-start to terminal queue in about `4m20s`. TerraformVariable summaries now show `singleton_statements=0` and grouped executions of about `13` to `33` per repo rather than hundreds of standalone executions; the largest repo in the proof reported `3461` rows, `736` statements, `30` executions, and `151.733s` total label duration while other projectors overlapped. Runtime sampling after drain remained idle-heavy (`cpu_idle` about `94.88%`, `io_wait=0%`, disk util about `2.70%`). Local verification passed focused TDD for Terraform variable brace fallbacks and NornicDB phase grouping plus `go test ./cmd/ingester ./internal/storage/neo4j ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. | Keep this as a correctness-preserving write-shape optimization, not a worker-count change. The full-corpus benchmark remains `30-35m`; any follow-up that moves fresh full-corpus wall toward `60m` must be rejected or isolated behind a measured knob. Next proof should run the full corpus from a fresh rebuild and compare section timing before promoting any additional Terraform or source-local tuning. |
| Full-corpus Terraform contention recheck | Rejected regression | Fresh full-corpus proof `pcg-full-benchmark-clean-ee46eef7-20260502T001211Z` used `ee46eef7` after stopping an invalid overlapping run. It intentionally kept the benchmark defaults: `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS=4`, `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS=8`, `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=nornicdb`, deferred content-search indexes enabled, batched containment enabled, no large-generation override, and no TerraformVariable phase cap. The run crossed the accepted `35m` regression line at about `35.8m` with queue state `succeeded=2685`, `pending=3565`, `retrying=64`, `running=3`, and `claimed=9`. Stage detail showed source-local still active (`724` succeeded, `150` pending, `3` running) while `semantic_entity_materialization` had only `9` succeeded plus `64` retrying. Logs showed semantic label writes timing out at the `120s` canonical write deadline even for tiny row sets such as `1`, `5`, `10`, and `50` rows, while source-local TerraformVariable canonical writes were also active. | Rejected as a full-corpus regression against the `30-35m` benchmark. The evidence points to unsafe mixed graph-backend contention between active source-local canonical writes and semantic entity label writes, not to a need for more reducer workers. |
| TerraformVariable phase cap proof | Rejected hypothesis | Config-only proof `pcg-full-benchmark-tfvar5-ee46eef7-20260502T004849Z` added `PCG_NORNICDB_ENTITY_LABEL_PHASE_GROUP_STATEMENTS=TerraformVariable=5` to the same benchmark defaults. The smaller cap shortened individual TerraformVariable phase-group executions into roughly `8-18s` chunks, but multiplied chunk count enough that total source-local work remained high: representative large generations reported `94` rows / `69` statements / `14` executions / `177.887s`, and `1074` rows / `250` statements / `50` executions / `461.052s` while the run was still incomplete. At about `14.5m`, queue state was `succeeded=1849`, `pending=4208`, `retrying=31`, `claimed=11`, and semantic retries continued. | Rejected. Smaller TerraformVariable chunks reduce single-transaction hold time but do not remove the corpus wall-clock problem; they may increase total projector time. Do not promote this cap as a default. |
| Semantic source-local drain gate | Diagnostic scheduling cleanup; rejected as wall-clock win | Commit `80b14be2` adds TDD coverage and claim-query gating so `semantic_entity_materialization` waits until all source-local projector work has drained when the existing NornicDB/local-authoritative projector-drain gate is enabled. The scoped same-`scope_id` reducer gate remains in place for all domains, and non-semantic reducer domains still drain once their own source has passed the same-scope gate. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/ingester ./internal/projector ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. Remote proof `pcg-full-semantic-drain-80b14be2-20260502T011213Z` used the benchmark defaults with no TerraformVariable cap. It proved the gate worked: at `36m11s`, semantic reducers were still pending-only (`290` pending, `0` retrying) while source-local remained active (`724/878` succeeded, `150` pending, `4` running). Overall queue had `0` retrying, `0` failed, and `0` dead-lettered rows. Host samples stayed unsaturated (`cpu_idle_avg=49.28%`, `io_wait_avg=0.17%`, `disk_idle_avg=95.27%`). The run was stopped after crossing the `35m` regression line. TerraformVariable canonical summaries isolated the remaining source-local bottleneck: examples included `1463` rows / `343` statements / `14` executions / `749.361s`, `1447` rows / `358` statements / `15` executions / `828.494s`, and many small brace-bearing groups with only `20-50` rows still taking `50-154s`. | Keep the semantic gate only as a correctness-preserving diagnostic cleanup that removes mixed semantic/source-local timeout noise. It is not a throughput win. The next slice must target TerraformVariable source-local canonical shape directly: first prove whether current NornicDB can accept batched brace metadata, then either remove the stale singleton fallback or introduce a safe explicit-property batched TerraformVariable writer. Do not raise reducer workers or promote smaller phase caps from this result. |
| TerraformVariable brace metadata batching | Focused wall-clock source-local win | Commit `cbb37526` removes the stale TerraformVariable curly-brace singleton fallback while keeping the proven `shortestPath` / `allShortestPaths` singleton safeguard. Local TDD first failed because brace-bearing TerraformVariable rows still emitted singleton statements; a live NornicDB compatibility test then proved the current backend accepts the batched `UNWIND` file-containment shape and returns brace-heavy `default`, `var_type`, and `description` metadata correctly when values are compared after read-back rather than through a fragile escaped-string equality predicate. Local verification passed `PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/Users/allen/os-repos/NornicDB/bin/nornicdb-headless go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestNornicDBBatchedTerraformVariableBraceMetadataCompatibility -count=1 -v`, `go test ./cmd/pcg ./cmd/ingester ./internal/storage/neo4j ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. Remote proof `pcg-tfvar-batched-cbb37526-20260502T020531Z` rebuilt Linux binaries first, set `PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY` explicitly for non-interactive SSH, and indexed four Terraform-heavy repos with benchmark defaults. It drained healthy with projector `4/4`, reducer `32/32`, queue `pending=0 in_flight=0 retrying=0 dead_letter=0 failed=0`, and `failures=none`; final readiness/index work completed about `32s` after owner start. TerraformVariable summaries were bounded: `3563` rows / `36` statements / `2` executions / `1.941s`, `3465` / `35` / `2` / `2.017s`, `3461` / `35` / `2` / `1.813s`, and `3909` / `40` / `2` / `2.130s`, all with `singleton_statements=0`. Canonical writes for the four repos were `3.766s`, `3.998s`, `4.139s`, and `5.028s`. Host samples stayed healthy: one sample showed CPU `92%` idle with disk util `1.80%`, and the final sample showed CPU `99%` idle with disk util `2.20%`. | Keep this targeted source-local writer cleanup and run the full-corpus benchmark next. This is the first proof that directly attacks the TerraformVariable long pole seen in the stopped full-corpus run, but promotion still depends on a fresh full-corpus wall-clock staying under the `30-35m` benchmark and preserving graph truth. |
| Full-corpus post-Terraform semantic contention recheck | Rejected regression | Fresh full-corpus proof `pcg-full-tfvar-batched-28563ff5-20260502T022315Z` used commit `28563ff5` with benchmark defaults: `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS=4`, `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS=8`, `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=nornicdb`, `PCG_QUERY_PROFILE=local_authoritative`, deferred content-search indexes enabled, batched entity containment enabled, no TerraformVariable phase cap, and no semantic claim cap. The run initially showed the TerraformVariable batching had removed the prior source-local singleton long pole, but after source-local drained the reducer claimed a wave of `semantic_entity_materialization` rows concurrently. Eight semantic writes then timed out at the `120s` canonical write deadline on tiny row sets such as `Function rows=1`, `Function rows=4`, `Module rows=1`, `Annotation rows=5`, and `TypeAnnotation rows=7/47`; semantic retrying rose from `4` to `12`. SQL/shared edges were still millisecond-scale, and the Cypher shape was already indexed by label plus `uid`, so the evidence points to NornicDB semantic write contention rather than an obvious missing PCG index or TerraformVariable batching regression. | Rejected as a concurrency regression against the `30-35m` benchmark. Do not increase reducer workers. Keep the TerraformVariable batching win, but add a semantic-specific claim discipline under the existing NornicDB/local-authoritative projector-drain gate so unrelated reducer domains can stay concurrent while semantic label writes cannot stampede the backend. |
| NornicDB semantic reducer claim cap | Implemented; needs fresh full-corpus rerun | Commit `632bd799` adds focused TDD coverage and caps `semantic_entity_materialization` claims under the existing NornicDB/local-authoritative projector-drain gate. Single-item claims now skip semantic work while another semantic reducer row is `claimed` or `running` with an active lease, and batch claims also use a `semantic_next` selector so one batch cannot claim multiple semantic rows at once. Non-semantic reducer domains retain their existing same-scope projector-drain behavior and worker concurrency. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/storage/postgres -run 'TestReducerQueueClaimGatesSemanticEntitiesOnGlobalProjectorDrain|TestClaimBatchGatesSemanticEntitiesOnGlobalProjectorDrain' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/storage/postgres ./cmd/reducer ./internal/reducer -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. Remote proof `pcg-full-semantic-cap-632bd799-20260502T024355Z` rebuilt Linux binaries and showed the cap working behaviorally before disk exhaustion invalidated the run: at about `117s`, semantic was `pending=297 succeeded=1` with no retrying; at about `252s`, semantic was `claimed=1 pending=322 succeeded=1`, again with no retrying or dead letters. Completed semantic rows ran one at a time with examples around `3.228s`, `7.788s`, `30.400s`, `35.706s`, and `54.242s` instead of `120s` timeout waves. The run is not valid wall-clock evidence because the remote root volume reached `100%` full, Postgres emitted `No space left on device` temp-file errors, `source_local` dead-lettered `27` rows, and NornicDB later refused connections. Generated proof artifacts were cleaned up, restoring about `99G` free. | Keep the scoped semantic cap as a contention guard, but rerun the full corpus after disk cleanup before claiming wall-clock acceptance. Also investigate a stronger collection-complete readiness gate: in watch-mode a momentary source-local enqueue gap can still let semantic begin before the entire corpus has been discovered, even though the cap prevents retry storms. |
| Local-host semantic corpus-complete gate | Implemented and pushed | Commit `2f0e3033` closes the second scheduling hole exposed by the invalid `632bd799` proof: the semantic source-local drain gate only checked currently enqueued source-local projector work. In local-host watch mode, repository discovery/enqueue can have short gaps, so a reducer could observe no open source-local rows before the ingester had enqueued all repos in the corpus. This slice passes the owner-discovered source-local projector count to `pcg-reducer` as `PCG_REDUCER_EXPECTED_SOURCE_LOCAL_PROJECTORS` and makes only `semantic_entity_materialization` wait until that many `source_local` projector rows have succeeded. The scoped same-scope projector gate and non-semantic reducer concurrency remain unchanged. Local TDD first failed on missing queue args, missing reducer config, and missing local-host env wiring; implementation then passed `go test ./internal/storage/postgres -run 'TestReducerQueueClaimGatesSemanticEntitiesOnGlobalProjectorDrain|TestReducerQueueClaimPassesExpectedSourceLocalProjectors|TestClaimBatchGatesSemanticEntitiesOnGlobalProjectorDrain|TestClaimBatchPassesExpectedSourceLocalProjectors|TestClaimBatchCanWaitForProjectorDrain' -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/reducer -run 'TestLoadReducerExpectedSourceLocalProjectors|TestBuildReducerServiceWiresExpectedSourceLocalProjectors|TestBuildReducerServiceWiresNornicDBProjectorDrainGate' -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestRunOwnedLocalHostWithLayoutAuthoritativeStartsManagedGraph -count=1`, `go test ./internal/storage/postgres ./cmd/reducer ./cmd/pcg ./internal/reducer -count=1`, `go vet ./internal/storage/postgres ./cmd/reducer ./cmd/pcg ./internal/reducer`, strict MkDocs, `git diff --check`, and a prohibited private-term scan over touched files. | Keep this as a correctness/scheduling gate. The fresh full-corpus proof below determines whether it is also a wall-clock win. |
| Full-corpus semantic corpus-complete gate recheck | Rejected wall-clock proof; correctness scheduling proof | Fresh full-corpus proof `pcg-full-semantic-complete-2f0e3033-20260502T030429Z` used commit `2f0e3033` after disk cleanup and remote Linux binary rebuilds. Benchmark defaults were unchanged: `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS=4`, `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS=8`, `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=nornicdb`, `PCG_QUERY_PROFILE=local_authoritative`, `PCG_CANONICAL_WRITE_TIMEOUT=120s`, deferred content-search indexes enabled, and batched entity containment enabled. The new expected-count gate behaved correctly: semantic work remained pending with `attempt_count=0` while source-local was `871/878` succeeded, then began only after source-local reached `878/878`. Pre-stop queue state had no retrying, failed, or dead-lettered rows. This was not a wall-clock win: around `19m`, semantic had only `2/368` rows succeeded with one claimed. Tiny NornicDB semantic statements were the long pole: one handler spent `70.731s` writing `3` rows, and another spent `371.127s` writing `19` rows through label batches such as `5` rows in about `95-104s` and `1` row in about `19.5s`. Host samples showed the primary disk was effectively idle on the hot sample (`0.10%` util), CPU was mostly idle (`82-88%` idle), and NornicDB was consuming about `4.3` cores while Postgres connections were mostly idle. Shutdown-generated connection-refused failures were ignored as proof artifacts. | Do not raise reducer workers. Keep the semantic claim cap and corpus-complete gate as correctness guards, then inspect the semantic entity Cypher/NornicDB label-update path directly. The next optimization must explain why label+`uid` writes over tiny row sets take tens to hundreds of seconds after the full graph is loaded. |
| NornicDB semantic node merge and source-shape proof | Implemented locally; proof pending | NornicDB commit `e710932` fixed a correctness bug where map-set `UNWIND MERGE` identities could collapse to literal values such as `row.entity_id`; the previous fast NornicDB semantic run is therefore not valid acceptance evidence because the graph was wrong. Follow-up NornicDB commit `da003dc` attempted a simple-node bulk-create hot path, but focused proof `pcg-semantic-hotpath-services4-da003dc-20260502T044148Z` was stopped as a rejected throughput hypothesis: it still used the previously rejected `PCG_NORNICDB_BATCHED_ENTITY_CONTAINMENT=true`, hit a source-local retry, and Function label summaries climbed to about `3000` rows, `200` statements, `40` executions, and `369.233s` total duration while CPU and disk remained mostly idle. NornicDB commit `62d20e4` reverted that ineffective hot path while keeping the correctness fix. A clean focused proof with batched containment disabled, `pcg-semantic-hotpath-services4-62d20e4-nobatched-20260502T045222Z`, improved early source-local chunks but still hit a `120s` canonical write timeout before reducers opened; label summaries pointed to a checked-in FilePond/PQINA browser library (`public/js/pqina/filepond.esm.js`) dominating Function and Variable canonical writes. This PCG slice adds a generic FilePond/PQINA vendored-browser-library signature with TDD coverage and updates the local testing reference. Local verification passed `go test ./internal/collector -run 'TestResolveNativeSnapshotFileSetSkipsLegacyVendoredLibraries|TestResolveNativeSnapshotFileSetSkipsGeneratedJavaScriptBundles|TestResolveNativeSnapshotFileSetKeepsSmallBootstrapLikeJavaScript' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/collector ./internal/collector/discovery -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/ingester ./internal/collector ./internal/content/shape -count=1`, `git diff --check`, and strict MkDocs. | Push, rebuild remote Linux binaries, and rerun the same four-repo proof with NornicDB `62d20e4`, `PCG_NORNICDB_BATCHED_ENTITY_CONTAINMENT=false`, and API/MCP database set to `nornic`. Acceptance requires no FilePond hot chunks, no source-local retry/dead letters, reducer work opening normally, and direct raw graph/API JSON showing real semantic node identities rather than literal row expressions. |
| JWPlayer source-shape follow-up | Implemented locally; proof pending | Commit `d29161dd` was pushed and tested in focused proof `pcg-semantic-hotpath-services4-62d20e4-nobatched-20260502T050838Z` after rebuilding PCG and NornicDB `62d20e4` on the remote host. The FilePond/PQINA hot chunks disappeared and the skip counters rose (`portal-java-ycm` reported `files_skipped.content.vendored-browser-library=6`, `webapp-grails-imt=22`), but the proof still failed before reducers opened: source-local stayed running for all four repos, CPU/disk remained unsaturated (`cpu_idle` mostly `56-68%`, `io_wait=0-1%`, `disk_idle` mostly `95.59%`), and one projector retried at `2026-05-02T05:15:47Z` after a `120s` canonical entity timeout on `Annotation` rows. The logs then exposed another generic checked-in browser-library family missed by path/content signatures: JWPlayer plugin/provider files under a `jwplayer/` directory (`provider.shaka.js`, `provider.html5.js`, `provider.hlsjs.js`, `jwplayer.js`) dominated repeated Function chunks, with examples such as `webapp-grails-imt` Function summaries reaching `2365` rows / `250` statements / `50` executions / `255.126s`, and `portal-java-ycm` file writes taking `256.848s` for `36` statements. This slice adds a generic `jwplayer/` JavaScript directory skip with red/green TDD coverage; it is still data-shape pruning, not a reducer worker-count change. | Run local verification, push, rebuild remote binaries, and rerun the same focused proof. If JWPlayer pruning still leaves source-local retries, stop treating individual browser-library signatures as the main lever and move to NornicDB canonical file/entity write-shape work with direct backend profiling. |
| Post-JWPlayer NornicDB contention proof | Rejected source-shape hypothesis; contention A/B pending | Commit `87e86e2e` was pushed and tested in focused proof `pcg-semantic-hotpath-services4-62d20e4-nobatched-20260502T052112Z` after rebuilding PCG and NornicDB `62d20e4`. The JWPlayer source-shape skip worked: one large web repo moved from `22` to `48` skipped vendored-browser-library files. The run still retried before reducers opened, with first queue at `2026-05-02T05:21:31Z`, retry at `2026-05-02T05:28:34Z`, and `reducer_done=0/0` when stopped. CPU and disk remained unsaturated. The decisive clue is that the exact `Annotation` canonical entity chunk that timed out at the `120s` write deadline later succeeded on retry in `0.665s`. That rejects "this generated file or label is inherently a two-minute query" and points to NornicDB write contention or transaction waiting under concurrent source-local canonical graph writes. | Run the same four-repo proof as an A/B with `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS=1` while keeping reducer workers and Cypher shape unchanged. If retries disappear and wall time improves or stays acceptable, test `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS=2` next and consider a scoped NornicDB graph-write concurrency limiter rather than serializing the whole ingestion path. |
| Cross-file entity containment hot-path order | Implemented locally; proof pending | Diagnostic A/B `pcg-semantic-hotpath-services4-62d20e4-nobatched-workers1-20260502T053733Z` set `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS=1` and kept the same four-repo corpus, NornicDB `62d20e4`, and batched containment disabled. It was stopped as a rejected worker-count mitigation: after more than `10m`, the first source-local item was still running, reducers had not opened, and host samples stayed unsaturated (`cpu_idle` about `90-92%`, `io_wait=0%`, `disk_idle` about `95.59%`). The run was not idle; logs showed file-scoped `Variable` entity chunks steadily completing but often taking `5-30s` per tiny statement. That proved the current file-scoped inline containment shape emits too many costly statements even without competing projectors. This slice changes only the cross-file batched containment template order from `MERGE entity -> MATCH file` to NornicDB's proven hot-path order `MATCH file by row.file_path -> MERGE entity -> MERGE CONTAINS`. Local TDD first failed on the old order and now passes; the live NornicDB compatibility test also accepts the hot-path-ordered batched containment query. | Push, rebuild remote binaries, and rerun the same four-repo proof with `PCG_NORNICDB_BATCHED_ENTITY_CONTAINMENT=true` and normal `PCG_PROJECTOR_WORKERS=4`. Acceptance requires source-local to drain without retries, entity label summaries to show far fewer executions per label, and raw graph/API JSON to prove entity identities and `CONTAINS` edges remain correct. |
