---

## Context

PlatformContextGraph already ingests Terraform **configuration** via the Git
collector and the Terraform config parser. That surfaces *intent*: what
resources the author declared, which modules they used, which backends were
wired, which `app_name` values were assigned.

Terraform **state** is a different source of truth. It reports what
Terraform believes it actually provisioned: real ARNs, resource IDs,
endpoints, names, tags, and the serial number of the last apply. Without
state, the platform can describe what the code *said*; it cannot describe what
the code *produced*.

The multi-source correlation ADR already named `terraform_state` as a
first-class collector family with its own `CollectorKind` and a
`state_snapshot` scope. The workflow coordinator ADR already defined the
runtime shape for a `collector-terraform-state` instance, its claim contract,
and how it plugs into the shared reducer and read paths.

This ADR is the collector-specific design ADR those two ADRs deferred. It
defines how the Terraform state collector observes source truth, how it is
configured, how it reads state across heterogeneous backends, how it protects
secrets, what facts it emits, and how it cooperates with the workflow
coordinator and the correlation DSL.

### What Is Already Decided

The following are contracts inherited from prior ADRs. This ADR does not
revisit them:

1. Collectors observe source truth and emit typed facts. They do not write
   canonical graph rows directly.
2. The reducer owns cross-source correlation. Drift detection, state-versus-
   config comparison, and state-versus-cloud comparison live in the
   correlation DSL, not in the state collector.
3. The workflow coordinator owns run creation, claim issuance, fencing,
   completeness, and operator-visible status. The state collector claims
   bounded work from the coordinator; it does not schedule itself.
4. `ScopeKind.state_snapshot` and `CollectorKind.terraform_state` already
   exist in the shared identity enums.
5. Collector instances are declarative: desired state lives in configuration,
   observed state lives in Postgres control-plane rows.

### What This ADR Decides

1. The set of state backends supported at launch.
2. How the collector discovers which state objects to read.
3. The `StateSource` abstraction that unifies local, S3/DynamoDB, and
   Terragrunt-resolved backends under one reader contract.
4. Scope and generation identity for a state snapshot.
5. Fact shapes emitted from state.
6. Secret redaction policy, because state files routinely contain plaintext
   credentials.
7. Streaming and size-discipline rules for large state files.
8. The correlation anchors state contributes to the DSL.
9. The phased rollout plan.

---

## Problem Statement

Without a Terraform state collector, PlatformContextGraph cannot truthfully
answer:

- Which real ARN corresponds to the resource declared in module X?
- Which concrete `aws_lb` hostname serves the release declared by chart Y?
- Which RDS endpoint backs the `api-node-chat` service in production?
- Did the last Terraform apply succeed, and what serial does the graph
  reflect?
- Does the code intent match what Terraform believes is deployed?
- Does Terraform believe it owns resources the AWS scanner has observed?

Those questions are the foundation for every cross-source correlation the
platform wants to support. They are also the foundation for drift detection,
orphan detection, and unmanaged-resource detection once the AWS scanner is
online.

The platform must now commit to:

- how the collector reads state without becoming a mutation risk
- how it handles the real-world heterogeneity of where state actually lives
- how it refuses to leak plaintext secrets present in state payloads
- how it stays within the facts-first, collector-local contract already
  established by the Git collector

---

## Decision

### Support Three Backend Families At Launch

The state collector should support, at launch:

1. **Local state files** (`terraform.tfstate` committed or generated inside a
   repository workspace)
2. **Amazon S3 remote backend** (with optional DynamoDB lock table used for
   read-only metadata only)
3. **Terragrunt-wrapped backends** that resolve to local or S3

The following are explicit non-goals for launch (deferred to later phases):

- Terraform Cloud / Terraform Enterprise workspace API
- Google Cloud Storage backend
- Azure Blob Storage backend
- HTTP backend
- Consul backend
- Postgres backend

Terragrunt is not a separate backend. Its `remote_state` block resolves to a
concrete backend (typically S3). The collector consumes the *resolved* backend
configuration. Terragrunt discovery belongs to the Terraform config parser,
which already exists in the Git collector surface.

### Unified `StateSource` Reader Abstraction

The collector should expose one reader interface that every backend
implementation satisfies:

```go
// go/internal/collector/terraformstate/source.go
type StateSource interface {
    // Identity returns the durable key for this state snapshot.
    Identity() StateKey

    // Open returns a streaming reader over the raw state payload and the
    // metadata required for generation assignment and freshness tracking.
    Open(ctx context.Context) (io.ReadCloser, StateMetadata, error)
}

type StateKey struct {
    BackendKind BackendKind // "local" | "s3" | "terragrunt"
    Locator     string      // canonical locator (e.g. s3://bucket/key or repo-relative path)
    Serial      int64       // terraform state serial; monotonic per locator
    Lineage     string      // terraform state lineage UUID; identifies the chain
}

type StateMetadata struct {
    ObservedAt     time.Time
    Size           int64
    ETag           string        // for S3; empty otherwise
    LastModified   time.Time
    LockDigest     string        // optional; from DynamoDB lock table, read-only
    BackendConfig  BackendConfig // full config that produced this source
}
```

Implementations at launch:

- `localStateSource` — reads the state payload from the Postgres content
  store first, falling back to on-disk workspace only when the collector
  runtime mandates it. Matches the `content store is authoritative` project
  rule.
- `s3StateSource` — uses AWS SDK v2 `s3.GetObject` with `If-None-Match`
  against the previously observed ETag. Optional DynamoDB `GetItem` against
  the lock table reads `LockID` and `Digest` for metadata only. The
  collector must never call `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`,
  `LockTable` APIs, or issue any state write on S3.
- `terragruntResolvedSource` — thin shim that resolves a Terragrunt remote
  state block (already parsed by the config collector) into the underlying
  `localStateSource` or `s3StateSource`. Terragrunt does not get its own
  reader; it gets a resolver.

### Discovery: Graph First, Declarative Fallback, Explicit Override

The collector must answer "which state objects should I read?" before any
backend traffic.

Discovery is layered:

1. **Explicit overrides** in collector instance configuration win when
   present. Operators may pin a state source when the graph is cold, when a
   state lives outside any scanned repository, or when testing.
2. **Graph-backed discovery** is the normal path. The collector queries the
   PCG Postgres content store for Terraform `backend` and Terragrunt
   `remote_state` facts emitted by the Git collector, producing a bounded
   set of candidate state sources.
3. **Declarative seed** is a bounded operator fallback for the first-ever
   run where no Git generation has completed yet. It is intended to be
   removed from configuration once the graph is warm.

The collector must never crawl S3 buckets, list prefixes speculatively, or
probe unknown accounts. Every state object read must trace back to either an
operator-declared source or a Git-collector-observed backend fact.

### Coordinator Run Dependencies

Because graph-backed discovery depends on Git collector output, the state
collector run must declare that dependency. The workflow coordinator already
supports run dependencies. The state collector must:

- refuse to run for a scope until the upstream Git generation for that scope
  has produced `canonical_nodes_committed`
- surface a readable "waiting on git generation X" status when blocked
- not invent fallback behavior that bypasses this gate

This prevents the platform from emitting state facts against an empty graph
and landing correlation decisions with missing upstream evidence.

### Scope And Generation Identity

Scope:

- `ScopeKind.state_snapshot`
- scope identity = `(backend_kind, locator)`
  - `(local, repo_id, workspace_path)`
  - `(s3, bucket, key, region)`
  - Terragrunt resolves to one of the above; does not produce its own scope

Generation:

- `generation = state.serial`
- state serial is monotonic by Terraform's own contract; the collector never
  invents a generation
- `lineage_uuid` is carried alongside and stored on every emitted fact so
  lineage rotations are detectable and not silently merged
- serial rollbacks (observed serial less than previously indexed serial for
  the same lineage) are rejected and emitted as a `failure_class` of
  `state_serial_regression`

### Fact Shapes

The collector emits a bounded set of typed facts. Names are scoped to the
collector family.

| Fact Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform_state_snapshot` | one per observed state object; carries serial, lineage, backend metadata, size, observed timestamp |
| `terraform_state_resource` | one per resource instance in the state (`type`, `name`, `module`, `provider`, `mode`, attributes; includes `arn`, `id`, `name`, `tags` when present) |
| `terraform_state_output` | one per named output (name, sensitive flag, value digest) |
| `terraform_state_module` | one per module block (source, version, path, inputs digest) |
| `terraform_state_provider_binding` | one per provider configuration referenced by state (alias, region, assume role ARN when present, account hint) |
| `terraform_state_tag_observation` | tag key/value pairs extracted from resource attributes; separate fact for correlation indexing |
| `terraform_state_warning` | anti-pattern signals such as `state_in_vcs`, `plaintext_sensitive_value`, `lineage_rotation`, `serial_regression` |

Each fact carries:

- the shared fact envelope already used by the Git collector
- `scope_id`, `generation_id`, `collector_kind = terraform_state`
- `lineage_uuid`, `serial`, `backend_kind`, `locator`
- observed timestamp of the state snapshot

Facts are emitted in streaming fashion during state parsing; the collector
must not buffer an entire state file in memory as Go structs before emitting.

### Secret Redaction Policy

Terraform state routinely contains plaintext secrets. The collector must
refuse to persist those values, even transiently.

Mandatory redaction rules:

1. **`sensitive = true` outputs:** value is replaced with `sha256:<hex>` of
   the raw bytes. The hash lets the reducer correlate outputs across
   generations without storing the value.
2. **Known-sensitive attribute keys** on any resource (`password`,
   `master_password`, `secret_key`, `private_key`, `token`, `auth_token`,
   `access_key`, `*_secret`, `*_password`, `credentials`): replaced with
   `sha256:<hex>`. The key list is versioned and extensible per provider.
3. **Unknown provider schemas:** when the collector cannot classify an
   attribute's sensitivity (for example, a third-party provider absent from
   the packaged schema set), the attribute map is emitted with non-scalar
   values dropped and scalar values hash-redacted. This is a conservative
   default; loss of non-sensitive attributes is preferable to leaking
   sensitive ones. A `terraform_state_warning` with `failure_class =
   unknown_provider_schema` accompanies the fact so operators can request
   schema coverage.
4. **Raw state payload content** is not persisted to the PCG content store.
   Only redacted facts are persisted. This is a deviation from the Git
   collector's content-store-first rule and is intentional: the source
   material is too hazardous to hold.
5. **Logs and spans must never carry redacted values, raw attribute values,
   or output values.** Telemetry carries hashes, sizes, and counts only.

### Streaming And Size Discipline

State files can exceed 100 MB for monolith workspaces. Treat size as a
first-class concern.

Required behavior:

- Parse state using `json.Decoder` token streaming. No `json.Unmarshal` into
  a single struct.
- Emit facts on resource boundaries so the collector's memory footprint is
  bounded by the largest single resource attribute map, not the entire state.
- A hard size ceiling per state file defaults to **512 MB** and is
  configurable per collector instance. States exceeding the ceiling are
  rejected with `failure_class = state_too_large` and a warning fact.
- Observed size is recorded on `terraform_state_snapshot` and as a histogram
  metric.

### Correlation Anchors Surfaced To The DSL

The collector emits raw correlation keys. The correlation DSL normalizes.

Anchors this collector contributes:

- `arn` (any attribute named `arn`, `role_arn`, `target_group_arn`, etc.)
- `aws_account_id` (parsed from any observed ARN)
- `region` (from provider binding and from ARN segments)
- `resource_id` (Terraform `id` attribute)
- `resource_name` (Terraform `name` attribute)
- `tags` (key/value pairs; emitted unchanged, normalized by DSL)
- `module_source_path` (module provenance)
- `module_version`
- `provider_alias`
- `workspace` (Terraform workspace name, when not `default`)
- `lineage_uuid` (join across serial boundaries)
- `output_name` (for DSL rules that match by output identity)

Tag normalization, value aliasing, and precedence rules are **not** this
collector's concern. Those belong to the correlation DSL (see follow-up tag
taxonomy addendum to the DSL ADR).

### Drift Is Not Collected Here

This collector emits observed state. It does not compute drift.

- Drift between state and Terraform config lives in the reducer as a DSL
  rule joining `terraform_config_resource` facts with
  `terraform_state_resource` facts on `(module_source_path, resource_type,
  resource_name)`.
- Drift between state and cloud observation lives in the reducer as a DSL
  rule joining `terraform_state_resource` with AWS scanner facts on `arn`.
- Orphan detection (state resource with no config backing) and unmanaged
  detection (cloud resource with no state backing) also live in the DSL.

The collector's only job is to make those joins possible with clean, typed,
redacted, provenance-preserving facts.

## Architecture

### Runtime Shape

The collector is a long-running service:

- binary: `/usr/local/bin/pcg-collector-terraform-state`
- package: `go/cmd/collector-terraform-state/`
- internal: `go/internal/collector/terraformstate/`
- Kubernetes: `Deployment` (not `StatefulSet` — no workspace PVC needed;
  state is read from content store or S3)
- replicas: `>= 1`, horizontally scalable under the coordinator claim model

### Package Layout

```text

        telemetry.go         # span/metric helpers
```

### Collector Instance Configuration

```yaml
collectors:
  - id: tfstate-prod
    kind: terraform_state
    mode: scheduled
    enabled: true
    bootstrap: true
    config:
      # Discovery
      discovery:
        graph: true
        seeds:
          # Explicit overrides; removed once graph is warm
          - kind: s3
            bucket: boats-tfstate-prod
            key: services/api-node-chat/terraform.tfstate
            region: us-east-1
            dynamodb_lock_table: boats-tfstate-locks
        local_repos:
          # Limit local discovery to these repo IDs
          - boats/platform-infra

      # Credentials for S3 backends
      aws:
        role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/pcg-tfstate-reader
        external_id: ${secret:aws.tfstate.external_id}

      # Safety
      max_state_bytes: 536870912   # 512 MB
      refresh_interval: 15m
      schema_sources:
        - path: /etc/pcg/terraform-schemas
```

Multiple instances allowed when states live across accounts or backends with
incompatible credentials.

### Control Flow

1. Coordinator issues a claim for a `(tfstate instance, scope batch)` unit
   of work.
2. Discovery produces the candidate `StateKey` list for that batch (graph +
   overrides, deduplicated).
3. For each key:
   a. Open the `StateSource`, get a streaming reader and metadata.
   b. Compare observed `(lineage_uuid, serial)` against the prior indexed
      values. If equal, emit a `terraform_state_snapshot` fact with
      `unchanged = true` and release the claim segment. No further facts.
   c. If changed, stream-parse; emit facts per resource / output / module /
      provider binding / tag observation.
   d. Apply redaction in the parse loop.
   e. Enqueue emitted facts to the shared fact queue.
4. Coordinator receives completion acknowledgment with counts, serial, and
   lineage.
5. Reducer consumes state facts via the existing queue substrate. No change
   to reducer wiring beyond new domain handlers in the DSL.

### S3 Read-Only Posture

IAM policy for the state collector's assume-role target must grant only:

- `s3:GetObject`, `s3:GetObjectVersion`
- `s3:ListBucket` (scoped to the specific keys or key prefixes configured)
- `dynamodb:GetItem`, `dynamodb:Query` on configured lock tables

It must not grant:

- any `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`, or bucket-level write
- any `dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:UpdateItem`, `dynamodb:DeleteItem`
- any `LockTable` or transaction APIs on the lock table

The collector code must also carry a runtime guard that rejects backend
configurations which claim write permissions. This is defense in depth; the
IAM policy is the primary control.

### Local State Caveat

Local state committed to a repository is a security anti-pattern. The
collector still reads it (operators need visibility), but emits a
`terraform_state_warning` with `warning_kind = state_in_vcs` and the repo +
path. This becomes a visible signal to operators rather than silently ingested
plaintext-on-disk.

Local state discovered outside a scanned repository (for example, a path
mounted into the collector container) is rejected unless explicitly listed as
a seed.

---

## Invariants

After this collector lands, the following must hold:

1. The collector never issues a write to any state backend. No `PutObject`,
   no `PutItem`, no lock acquisition.
2. No raw state payload is persisted to the PCG content store or to any
   PCG-owned database column.
3. Every emitted fact carries `scope_id`, `generation_id` (equal to state
   serial), and `lineage_uuid`.
4. No sensitive attribute value or output value is emitted in plaintext.
   Redaction is enforced in the parser path, not as a post-hoc filter.
5. No state-level fact is emitted before the parser confirms a non-regressing
   `(lineage_uuid, serial)` pair.
6. Discovery may not read a state object that was not produced by either an
   explicit seed or a Git-collector-observed backend fact.
7. The collector does not compute drift. Drift lives in the reducer.
8. Collector runs are gated on upstream Git generation readiness for the
   corresponding scope when graph-backed discovery is in use.
9. Claim ownership, fencing, and completeness flow through the workflow
   coordinator's shared contract. The collector does not invent its own.

---

## Observability Requirements

Metrics (prefix `pcg_dp_tfstate_`):

- `snapshots_observed_total{backend_kind, result}`
- `snapshot_bytes_bucket` (histogram of raw state size)
- `resources_emitted_total{backend_kind}`
- `outputs_emitted_total{backend_kind}`
- `redactions_applied_total{reason}`
- `warnings_emitted_total{warning_kind}`
- `backend_errors_total{backend_kind, error_class}`
- `discovery_candidates_total{source}` (`graph` vs `seed`)
- `parse_duration_seconds_bucket{backend_kind}`
- `serial_regressions_total`
- `lineage_rotations_total`
- `unknown_provider_schema_total{provider}`
- `s3_conditional_get_not_modified_total` (successful 304 responses)

Spans:

- `tfstate.collector.claim.process`
- `tfstate.discovery.resolve`
- `tfstate.source.open`
- `tfstate.parser.stream`
- `tfstate.fact.emit_batch`

Structured logs must include `scope_id`, `generation_id` (serial),
`lineage_uuid`, `backend_kind`, `locator`. They must not include attribute
values, output values, or raw state bytes.

Admin status should expose, per instance:

- last observed serial per locator
- last observed timestamp per locator
- current claim ownership
- outstanding discovery candidates
- recent warnings summarized by `warning_kind`

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

1. Terraform Cloud / Terraform Enterprise workspace support at launch.
2. GCS, Azure Blob, HTTP, Consul, or Postgres backends at launch.
3. Writing or mutating any state backend.
4. Computing drift between state and config.
5. Computing drift between state and cloud truth.
6. Storing raw state payloads.
7. Replacing or bypassing the workflow coordinator's claim contract.
8. Defining tag normalization rules (deferred to correlation DSL).
9. Replacing the Git collector's role in emitting `terraform_config_*` facts.

---

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Design And Identity

- publish this ADR
- extend `go/internal/scope` and `go/internal/facts` as needed to cover
  `state_snapshot` scope shape details
- add operator documentation for the collector instance config contract
- confirm the coordinator's run-dependency model covers `tfstate after git`
  scope gating

### Phase 2: Local + S3 Reader, Streaming Parser, Redaction

- implement the `StateSource` interface with `localStateSource` and
  `s3StateSource`
- implement streaming parser + redaction
- emit `terraform_state_snapshot` and `terraform_state_resource` facts
- integrate with coordinator claim loop under dark-run mode
- unit + fixture tests for:
  - serial monotonicity
  - lineage rotation detection
  - redaction of known-sensitive keys
  - unknown-provider-schema conservative redaction
  - size-ceiling enforcement

### Phase 3: Terragrunt Resolution And Output/Module/Tag Facts

- add the Terragrunt resolver shim
- emit `terraform_state_output`, `terraform_state_module`,
  `terraform_state_provider_binding`, `terraform_state_tag_observation`,
  `terraform_state_warning`
- admin status surface complete

### Phase 4: Reducer / DSL Integration

- correlation DSL rule packs for state-versus-config drift
- correlation DSL rule packs for state-to-cloud joins by ARN (depends on AWS
  scanner ADR rollout)
- reducer domain wiring for `deployable_unit_correlation` to consume state
  facts

### Phase 5: Expanded Backends (Post-Launch)

- Terraform Cloud / Enterprise workspace API
- GCS, Azure Blob
- HTTP, Consul
- considered per demand; not committed here

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- Platform gains concrete resource identity (ARNs, IDs, endpoints) that the
  Git collector alone cannot provide.
- Correlation DSL gains the strongest join key available for cloud
  correlation (`arn`) without inferring it.
- Drift detection and orphan detection become expressible as DSL rules
  rather than custom code.
- The coordinator's run-dependency model is exercised end to end for the
  first time.

### Negative

- Introduces a new runtime with privileged credentials (cross-account S3
  read) that must be audited and rotated.
- Introduces the first PCG source where raw payload is intentionally
  discarded. This is a deviation from the content-store-first rule and must
  be documented operationally.
- Adds a new failure class (`state_serial_regression`,
  `unknown_provider_schema`) that operators must learn.

### Risks

- **Secret leakage through unknown schemas.** Mitigated by conservative
  default redaction and explicit `unknown_provider_schema` telemetry.
- **Scan storms** when a large org has hundreds of state files and the
  refresh interval is too tight. Mitigated by the coordinator's claim
  fairness rules and by `If-None-Match` conditional reads.
- **Lineage collisions** across workspaces that share locators by accident.
  Mitigated by storing `lineage_uuid` on every fact and refusing silent
  merges across lineage rotations.
- **Terraform version skew.** State schema evolves. The parser must target a
  specific state schema version range and reject unknown versions explicitly
  rather than best-effort parsing.

## Recommendation

The platform should ship the Terraform State collector as a dedicated
runtime with a unified `StateSource` abstraction covering local, S3, and
Terragrunt-resolved backends. It should lean on graph-backed discovery with
an operator-declarable seed list, gate runs on upstream Git readiness, and
treat secret redaction as a parser-level invariant rather than a post-hoc
filter.

Shipping this collector turns the graph from "what the code said" into "what
Terraform believes it built," which is the prerequisite for the AWS scanner
collector and for all drift, orphan, and unmanaged-resource correlation that
follows.
