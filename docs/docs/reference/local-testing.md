# Local Testing Reference

This page is the verification reference for engineers and agents changing PCG.
For first-time local setup, use [Run Locally](../run-locally/index.md).

Use the smallest gate that proves the touched behavior, then run the hygiene
checks required by the files you changed. Do not call work ready without citing
the commands you actually ran.

For operator checks, use [Operate PCG](../operate/index.md). For process
health, readiness, and completeness, use
[Health Checks](../operate/health-checks.md).

## Common Compose Environment

When running commands directly against the default local Compose stack:

```bash
export PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=nornicdb
export NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
export NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=change-me
export DEFAULT_DATABASE=nornic
export PCG_NEO4J_DATABASE=nornic
export PCG_CONTENT_STORE_DSN=postgresql://pcg:change-me@localhost:15432/platform_context_graph
export PCG_POSTGRES_DSN=postgresql://pcg:change-me@localhost:15432/platform_context_graph
```

For `docker-compose.neo4j.yml`, use `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=neo4j` and database
`neo4j` instead.

## Discovery Advisory Playbook

Use this loop when a repository is slow, unexpectedly large, or timeout-heavy.
It is diagnostic evidence, not a stable API contract.

1. Capture the current shape:

    ```bash
    pcg index /path/to/repo --discovery-report /tmp/pcg-discovery-before.json
    ```

2. Inspect `summary.content_files`, `summary.content_entities`,
   `top_noisy_directories`, `top_noisy_files`, `entity_counts.by_type`, and
   `skip_breakdown`.

3. Choose the narrowest config:

    - `.pcg/discovery.json` for auditable vendored, generated, archive, or
      copied third-party roots.
    - `preserved_path_globs` when a broad ignored root may contain authored
      code.
    - `.pcgignore` when a plain ignore is enough.

4. Rerun with a second report:

    ```bash
    pcg index /path/to/repo --discovery-report /tmp/pcg-discovery-after.json
    ```

5. Accept the config only when the after-report shows the intended skip reason
   and the repository became cheaper for the intended reason.

Do not change graph-write timeouts, global batch sizes, or NornicDB row caps
until the report proves the input shape is already correct.

## Go Runtime Package Gate

Use this gate when validating the current runtime and collector wiring.

```bash
cd go
go test ./internal/parser ./internal/collector/discovery ./internal/content/shape \
  ./internal/collector ./cmd/collector-git ./cmd/ingester ./cmd/bootstrap-index \
  ./internal/runtime ./internal/app ./internal/telemetry \
  ./internal/storage/cypher ./internal/storage/neo4j ./internal/storage/postgres \
  ./internal/projector ./internal/reducer ./cmd/reducer -count=1
```

## Local-Authoritative Gates

Before a local-authoritative run that executes local PCG binaries, rebuild the
owner and child binaries and put the install directory on `PATH`.

```bash
./scripts/install-local-binaries.sh
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
```

Use these focused gates when touching local-host startup, graph-backed query
compatibility, or NornicDB routing:

```bash
PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/pcg-bare-install-smoke/bin/nornicdb-headless \
PCG_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_PERF=true \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestLocalAuthoritativeStartupEnvelope -count=1 -v

PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/pcg-bare-install-smoke/bin/nornicdb-headless \
PCG_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_PERF=true \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestLocalAuthoritativeCallChainSyntheticEnvelope -count=1 -v

PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/pcg-bare-install-smoke/bin/nornicdb-headless \
PCG_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_PERF=true \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestLocalAuthoritativeTransitiveCallersSyntheticEnvelope -count=1 -v

PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/pcg-bare-install-smoke/bin/nornicdb-headless \
PCG_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_PERF=true \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestLocalAuthoritativeDeadCodeSyntheticEnvelope -count=1 -v
```

Manual MCP local-authoritative smokes should end with:

```bash
pcg graph stop --workspace-root "$PWD"
pcg graph status --workspace-root "$PWD"
```

The status output should report no active owner for that workspace.

## Compose Verification Gates

Run these one at a time. They allocate local ports and reuse Compose project
state, so parallel runs will collide.

```bash
./scripts/verify_collector_git_runtime_compose.sh
./scripts/verify_projector_runtime_compose.sh
./scripts/verify_reducer_runtime_compose.sh
./scripts/verify_incremental_refresh_compose.sh
./scripts/verify_relationship_platform_compose.sh
./scripts/verify_admin_refinalize_compose.sh
./scripts/verify_graph_analysis_compose.sh
./scripts/verify_correlation_dsl_compose.sh
```

Use `./scripts/verify_product_truth_fixtures.sh` when changing a feature PCG
claims as product truth across graph, evidence, API, MCP, CLI, or cleanup
workflows.

## NornicDB Grouped-Write Safety

Use this opt-in gate when touching grouped canonical writes or
`PCG_NORNICDB_CANONICAL_GROUPED_WRITES`.

```bash
PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/nornicdb-headless \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestNornicDBGroupedWriteSafetyProbe -count=1 -v
```

The stricter promotion gate is:

```bash
PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/nornicdb-headless-pcg-rollback \
PCG_NORNICDB_REQUIRE_GROUPED_ROLLBACK=true \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestNornicDBGroupedWriteRollbackConformance -count=1 -v
```

Normal laptop runs should leave `PCG_NORNICDB_CANONICAL_GROUPED_WRITES` unset
until the latest NornicDB `main` binary under evaluation passes broader
adapter conformance and the release or accepted-build policy is settled.

## Terraform Provider-Schema Gate

Use this gate when touching Terraform provider schemas or schema-driven
relationship extraction.

```bash
cd go
go test ./internal/terraformschema ./internal/relationships ./internal/storage/postgres -count=1
```

The canonical packaged schemas live under
`go/internal/terraformschema/schemas/*.json.gz`.

## Runtime Tree Hygiene

The deployable runtime tree is Go-only. Use this check when confirming that
runtime implementation has not drifted into Python.

```bash
rg --files . -g '*.py' | rg -v '^(\\./)?tests/fixtures/'
```

Fixture data under `tests/fixtures/` and explicitly offline-only tooling can
still carry Python source when they are not part of the deployable runtime.

## Concurrency Tuning Reference

Set any variable to `1` to force sequential processing during debugging.

| Env var | Default | Service | Controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PCG_PROJECTION_WORKERS` | `min(NumCPU, 8)` | Bootstrap Index | Concurrent bootstrap projection goroutines |
| `PCG_SNAPSHOT_WORKERS` | `min(NumCPU, 4)` | Ingester / Bootstrap | Concurrent repository snapshot goroutines |
| `PCG_REDUCER_WORKERS` | NornicDB: `min(NumCPU, 8)`; Neo4j: `min(NumCPU, 4)` | Reducer | Concurrent reducer intent execution goroutines |
| `PCG_REDUCER_BATCH_CLAIM_SIZE` | NornicDB: `workers`; Neo4j: `workers * 4` capped at `64` | Reducer | Reducer intents leased per claim cycle |
| `PCG_REDUCER_SEMANTIC_ENTITY_CLAIM_LIMIT` | NornicDB: `1`; otherwise disabled | Reducer | Concurrent semantic entity materialization claims after source-local drain |
| `PCG_CODE_CALL_PROJECTION_ACCEPTANCE_SCAN_LIMIT` | `250000` | Reducer | Maximum code-call shared intents scanned or loaded for one accepted repo/run before failing safely |
| `PCG_SHARED_PROJECTION_WORKERS` | `1` | Reducer | Concurrent shared projection partition goroutines |
| `PCG_SHARED_PROJECTION_PARTITION_COUNT` | `8` | Reducer | Partitions per shared projection domain |
| `PCG_SHARED_PROJECTION_BATCH_LIMIT` | `100` | Reducer | Intents processed per partition batch |
| `PCG_SHARED_PROJECTION_POLL_INTERVAL` | `5s` | Reducer | Shared projection poll interval |
| `PCG_SHARED_PROJECTION_LEASE_TTL` | `60s` | Reducer | Partition lease time-to-live |

Validate queue work beyond the happy path:

- expired claims can be reclaimed
- overdue claims surface through status
- ack failures emit logs and metrics
- structured logs keep failure class, queue name, and work item identity

## Docs And Hygiene

Docs, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and README changes require:

```bash
uv run --with mkdocs --with mkdocs-material --with pymdown-extensions \
  mkdocs build --strict --clean --config-file docs/mkdocs.yml
git diff --check
```
