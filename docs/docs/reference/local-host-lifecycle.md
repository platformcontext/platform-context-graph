# Local Host Lifecycle

This document defines the intended shutdown and recovery sequence for the
lightweight local host.

## Normal Startup

1. acquire `owner.lock`
2. validate `VERSION`
3. validate or reclaim stale owner record
4. start embedded Postgres and wait until it accepts local connections
5. if profile is `local_authoritative`, start the local graph backend
   sidecar and wait until its recorded loopback health and Bolt endpoints
   accept connections
6. start local host socket
7. start watcher / index pipeline
8. begin serving CLI and MCP attach traffic

Step 5 is skipped entirely on `local_lightweight`. The graph sidecar is
configured and installed independently of the PCG binary; see
`graph-backend-installation.md` and `graph-backend-operations.md`.

In `local_authoritative`, `pcg-ingester --watch` may exit cleanly after it has
finished the current collection stream. That is not an owner shutdown signal:
the local host keeps Postgres, the graph sidecar, and `pcg-reducer` alive so
queued projection/reduction work can drain and attached CLI/MCP reads can keep
using the workspace owner. The supervisor logs that allowed child exit so
operators can distinguish intentional collection completion from owner teardown.

## Clean Shutdown

1. stop accepting new work
2. drain or cancel watcher intake
3. request child runtimes to stop and wait for them to exit cleanly
4. allow durable queues to retain any canceled in-flight projector work so a
   later local start can reclaim and retry it once the queue lease expires
5. if profile is `local_authoritative`, signal the graph backend to stop
   accepting new writes and wait for quiesce
6. flush and stop the graph backend sidecar (if present)
7. flush and stop embedded Postgres
8. remove owner record or mark shutdown complete
9. release `owner.lock`

Ordering note: Postgres outlives the child runtimes that write to it. The
current local-lightweight host requests a clean child shutdown first and then
stops Postgres only after those children have exited. If a projector batch is
canceled during shutdown, the durable Postgres queue remains the recovery point
for a subsequent local start after lease-based reclaim.

## Crash Recovery

On restart:

1. recover Postgres via normal WAL replay
2. if a graph backend PID is recorded in `owner.json`, probe its health;
   if still alive but the PCG owner is dead, attempt a clean internal stop
   through the recorded PID before reclaiming
3. detect stale owner
4. reclaim ownership only after lock acquisition, liveness checks, and
   any graph-backend stop step above has succeeded
5. rebuild any derived local caches if necessary

For the current NornicDB-backed path, graph health is loopback-TCP based:

- `graph_pid` must still be alive
- `graph_http_port` must answer `GET /health`
- `graph_bolt_port` must still accept loopback TCP connections

## Concurrency Note

MCP stdio requests should be multiplexable, but the runtime must enforce bounded
concurrency rather than unbounded fan-out under heavy client load.

Initial target:

- one bounded global query worker pool per local host
- requests beyond the pool limit queue briefly or fail fast with
  `error.code=overloaded`

## Attach Model

The long-running local host owns the workspace and watcher lifecycle. Other
commands such as `pcg mcp stdio` should attach to that owner rather than trying
to become competing workspace owners.

If `pcg mcp stdio` starts and no healthy owner exists for the workspace, it may
self-host as an ephemeral owner for that workspace. In that mode it must:

- acquire normal workspace ownership
- start the same embedded Postgres and watcher lifecycle needed for its scope
- emit an operator-visible note that it is running in self-hosted local mode
- cleanly stop and release ownership when the stdio session ends

## Signal Handling

- `SIGINT`
  - graceful stop path
- `SIGTERM`
  - graceful stop path
- `SIGKILL`
  - crash-recovery path on next start
