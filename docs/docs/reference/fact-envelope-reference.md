# Fact Envelope And Collector Plugin Reference

This page consolidates the PCG collector contract: what collectors emit, how
plugins are packaged and trusted, and the compatibility rules that gate plugin
activation. It is the user-facing reference for contributors building a new
collector family.

For the formal specs behind this reference:

- [Fact Schema Versioning](fact-schema-versioning.md)
- [Plugin Trust Model](plugin-trust-model.md)

## Collector contract at a glance

Collectors do two things and only two things:

1. Observe source truth (git repos, Terraform state, Kubernetes manifests,
   Helm, ArgoCD, Crossplane, …).
2. Emit **versioned facts** against the PCG fact envelope.

Collectors do NOT:

- Write directly to the canonical graph. The reducer and graph-write layer
  own that.
- Apply durable-store DDL migrations. Core runtime owns DDL.
- Synthesize truth from multiple sources. That is reducer ownership.

Why: this seam is the reason OCI-packaged plugins can ship without patching
the core runtime, and the reason adding a new collector family does not risk
corrupting canonical graph state.

## Fact envelope

Every fact carries two identity fields:

- `fact_kind` — the domain kind this fact describes.
- `schema_version` — semantic version of the fact schema.

Core fact kinds are owned by PCG. Plugin fact kinds must use a
collision-resistant prefix (reverse-DNS recommended) so two plugins cannot
claim the same kind.

Example fact envelope (abbreviated):

```json
{
  "fact_kind": "com.example.cloud-snapshot.resource",
  "schema_version": "1.2.0",
  "scope_id": "state-snapshot://prod/us-east-1/api-gateway",
  "generation_id": "state-serial-417",
  "payload": {
    "resource_id": "aws_api_gateway_rest_api.root",
    "resource_type": "aws_api_gateway_rest_api",
    "attributes": { "...": "..." }
  }
}
```

The full envelope shape is defined by the core Go fact types in
`go/internal/facts/`. Plugins serialize against the shared envelope; they do
not invent their own envelope shape.

## Compatibility rules

`schema_version` uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Runtime
behavior on mismatch:

| Bump | Runtime behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Major | If the runtime does not declare support for the emitted major, the runtime rejects the plugin or the emitted fact family. Hard error. No silent fallback. |
| Minor (runtime < plugin) | If the plugin emits a newer minor than the runtime understands, the runtime fails clearly rather than silently accepting unknown fields as authoritative. |
| Minor (runtime ≥ plugin) | Older fact rows with null/missing fields are preserved; the runtime does not invent values. |
| Patch | Must be backward-compatible and must not change semantic meaning. |

In-store migration policy:

- Backward-compatible readers may dual-read old + new schema versions during
  an operator-visible migration window.
- Incompatible schema changes require explicit migration or reindex paths.
- Silent in-place reinterpretation of stored facts is NOT allowed.

## Plugin manifest

Every OCI-packaged plugin ships with a manifest declaring:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin_id` | Unique plugin identity, used by allowlist and revocation. |
| `publisher_identity` | Publisher key / org identity. |
| `version` | Plugin semver. |
| `compatible_core_range` | Range of PCG core versions this plugin targets. |
| `emitted_fact_kinds` | List of fact kinds + supported `schema_version` set per kind. |
| `consumer_contract` | Downstream reducer or query consumer contract the plugin expects. |

Plugins introducing a new fact kind MUST also declare the consumer contract
expected to process it. Unknown fact kinds are never presented as active
platform truth.

### Example manifest

```yaml
plugin_id: com.example.cloud-snapshot
publisher_identity: example-corp
version: 1.4.0
compatible_core_range: ">=2.1.0 <3.0.0"
emitted_fact_kinds:
  - kind: com.example.cloud-snapshot.resource
    schema_versions: ["1.2.0"]
  - kind: com.example.cloud-snapshot.relationship
    schema_versions: ["1.0.0"]
consumer_contract:
  reducer: multi-source-reducer
  phases: ["resource_correlation"]
```

## Trust model

Plugins are untrusted by default. Activation requires operator configuration.

### Activation modes

| Mode | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `disabled` | All plugins ignored. |
| `allowlist` | Only explicitly approved plugin identities may load. |
| `strict` | Allowlist + signature / provenance verification required. |

### Verification checks

Before activation, the runtime MUST verify:

- Artifact identity matches the allowlisted plugin ID.
- Artifact provenance (preferred signing model: Sigstore / Cosign-compatible
  OCI artifact signatures).
- Fact schema compatibility (via manifest + envelope checks above).
- Operator allowlist or equivalent trust policy admits this publisher.

### Failure policy

- Incompatible or untrusted plugins fail closed.
- Failure logs identify the plugin and the violated rule.
- Operators may choose whether one plugin failure blocks startup entirely.
- Publisher identity rotation requires an explicit trust-transfer procedure.
  Silent key replacement is not allowed.

## Idempotency invariant

Facts MUST be idempotent under at-least-once delivery. Emitting the same fact
twice must not create divergent truth. Plugin authors are responsible for
enforcing this invariant in their emission code.

## Bump decision tree

When changing a fact schema, ask:

1. Does the change remove or semantically redefine an existing field? →
   **major bump**, requires explicit core support update.
2. Does the change add a field that readers can safely ignore? →
   **minor bump**, requires declared core compatibility.
3. Is the change a doc fix, bug fix with no semantic effect, or non-semantic
   correction? → **patch bump**.

When in doubt, bump higher. A conservative bump is cheap. A silent semantic
change destroys downstream correctness.

## Deprecation window

Unsupported major versions are not removed abruptly. The compatibility window
for a given major MUST be documented at release time so operators have a
predictable upgrade path.
