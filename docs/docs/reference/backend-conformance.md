# Backend Conformance

Backend conformance is the gate that keeps graph adapters honest.

PCG supports two official graph backends today:

- NornicDB, the default backend
- Neo4j, the compatibility backend

Both backends serve the same user-facing API and MCP capabilities. They do not
get to be called supported just because they accept Cypher. They have to pass
the same contract checks for reads, writes, traversal shape, dead-code
readiness, and performance evidence.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `specs/capability-matrix.v1.yaml` | User-facing capability and truth contract by runtime profile. |
| `specs/backend-conformance.v1.yaml` | Backend behavior classes, profile gates, and promotion status for official graph adapters. |
| `go/internal/backendconformance/` | Go harness for parsing the backend matrix and running shared read/write corpora. |

## What The Harness Covers

The default Go harness is intentionally DB-free. It proves the matrix is valid,
that it names the same official backends as the capability matrix, and that the
shared read/write corpora can run against any adapter that satisfies PCG's
graph ports.

The read corpus targets `GraphQuery`.

The write corpus targets the current Cypher executor family:

- `Executor`
- `GroupExecutor`
- `PhaseGroupExecutor`

PCG does not currently expose one concrete Go interface named `GraphWrite`.
When older ADR language says `GraphWrite`, read that as this Cypher write
executor family unless a later ADR formalizes a narrower interface.

## Live Backend Check

The live check runs the same corpus against a real Bolt endpoint. It is opt-in
so normal unit tests stay fast:

```bash
PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=nornicdb ./scripts/verify_backend_conformance_live.sh
PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=neo4j ./scripts/verify_backend_conformance_live.sh
```

The script defaults to the local Compose credentials and database names:
`nornic` for NornicDB and `neo4j` for Neo4j. Override the usual Bolt variables
when you are testing a different target:

```bash
PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=nornicdb \
PCG_NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687 \
PCG_NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j \
PCG_NEO4J_PASSWORD=change-me \
PCG_NEO4J_DATABASE=nornic \
./scripts/verify_backend_conformance_live.sh
```

GitHub Actions runs this live check in the end-to-end matrix before
`bootstrap-index`, so both official backends prove the shared read/write corpus
against a clean graph service.

## Profile Matrix

Chunk 5b is tracked in the same backend matrix under `profile_matrix`.
NornicDB must carry a gate for each profile that can use an authoritative
graph backend:

- `local_authoritative`
- `local_full_stack`
- `production`

The `local_authoritative` gate is backed by the opt-in local-host performance
tests plus the latest full-corpus API/MCP evidence. The `local_full_stack` gate
is backed by the NornicDB Compose matrix, now running with
`PCG_QUERY_PROFILE=local_full_stack`. The `production` gate now has a
latest-main full-corpus proof,
`pcg-full-pr138-a2c630af-b68b4ef-20260504T120630Z`:
it drained `8458/8458` queue rows in `878s`, kept retrying, failed, and
dead-letter rows at `0`, and passed API/MCP health plus relationship-evidence
drilldowns. It stays `evidence_pending` until the Neo4j support decision is
recorded: either optimize Neo4j and rerun a terminal comparison, or document
Neo4j as compatibility-only.

The current comparison evidence favors NornicDB but does not yet close the
Neo4j baseline gate. The 2026-05-04 Neo4j run
`pcg-neo4j-baseline-pr138-a2c630af-20260504T123656Z` was stopped by request
after `1946s`; it was still clean (`0` retrying, failed, or dead-letter rows)
but had only `553/896` source-local projector items succeeded. NornicDB had
already finished the whole corpus at `878s`.

That makes the next decision explicit. If PCG keeps Neo4j as more than a
compatibility fallback, the Neo4j adapter needs its own pass over the same
places tuned for NornicDB: canonical write grouping, entity containment shape,
semantic materialization, traversal builders, and backend-specific batch
limits. Those changes should be measured as Neo4j work, not copied blindly from
NornicDB.

The longer-term support bar is broader than these two databases. PCG should be
able to support backends that speak the Bolt/Cypher shape, but only through
narrow, documented adapter seams. A new backend should not force handler-level
branches or a pile of one-off query workarounds. Neo4j is still useful for
companies that already pay for and operate Neo4j, but the compatibility path
cannot remain dramatically slower than the default NornicDB path if we call it
production-promoted.

## Promotion Rule

Chunk 5 adds the deterministic harness, backend matrix, and live Compose-backed
adapter check. Chunk 5b records the profile-matrix proof across:

- `local_authoritative`
- `local_full_stack`
- `production`

NornicDB can remain the default while the remaining gate closes. Local and
Compose profile gates pass against latest `main`; production has strong
NornicDB evidence plus a stopped Neo4j SLO comparison. Production closure now
depends on the Neo4j support decision: optimize and rerun a terminal baseline,
or document Neo4j as compatibility-only while NornicDB carries the fast path.
