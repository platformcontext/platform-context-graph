# Environment Variables

This is the operator reference for PCG environment variables. Use it to answer
three questions before changing a value:

- What runtime reads this variable?
- What default does PCG use when it is unset?
- What symptom justifies tuning it?

Tune from evidence, not from vibes. A queue backlog, by itself, is not proof
that a worker count should go up; a timeout, by itself, is not proof that the
timeout should be longer. First identify the stage, phase, label, row count,
claim age, and latest failure class from the status panel, logs, or discovery
advisory report.

## Tuning Rules

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Change the narrowest knob that names the failing stage. | Broad knobs hide root cause and make later regressions harder to bisect. |
| Prefer filtering generated/vendor input before increasing graph-write budgets. | Bigger batches of wrong input still produce wrong or noisy graph truth. |
| Keep claim windows near worker count for slow backends. | Pre-claiming more work than workers can start causes lease expiry and duplicate work. |
| Increase timeouts only after the statement shape is proven correct. | A longer timeout can hide missing indexes, bad query routing, or row-shape bugs. |
| Record the before/after evidence in the active ADR for runtime-profile work. | Performance tuning without provenance turns into folklore. |

## Core Runtime

Do not use it as a performance knob. |
| `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND` | `neo4j` | API, MCP, ingester, reducer, local host | Selects graph adapter: `neo4j` or `nornicdb`. | Set to `nornicdb` only for the NornicDB evaluation/local-authoritative lane or a documented deployment using that adapter. |

| `PCG_METRICS_ADDR` | `0.0.0.0:9464` | Go service runtimes | Prometheus metrics listen address. | Change for deployment port binding or sidecar scrape layout. |
| `PCG_API_ADDR` | unset; CLI wrappers set host/port flags | API CLI service wrapper | API listen address when using `pcg service` helpers. | Use CLI flags first; set only for scripted local service wrappers. |

| `NEO4J_BOLT_PORT` | `7687` in compose examples | Docker Compose | Host Neo4j Bolt port. | Change to avoid local port conflicts. |
| `NEO4J_AUTH` | `neo4j/${PCG_NEO4J_PASSWORD:-change-me}` in compose | Neo4j container | Neo4j container auth string. | Prefer setting `PCG_NEO4J_PASSWORD` rather than editing this directly. |
| `NEO4J_AUTH_ENABLED` | `true` in legacy compose template | Neo4j container | Enables Neo4j auth in the template variant. | Leave enabled except for disposable local debugging. |
| `NEO4J_PLUGINS` | `[]` in compose | Neo4j container | Neo4j plugin list. | Leave empty unless a documented graph feature requires a plugin. |
| `PCG_NEO4J_HEAP_INITIAL_SIZE` | `512m` in compose | Docker Compose Neo4j container | Neo4j initial heap size. | Raise when compose Neo4j OOMs or GC thrashes during validation. |
| `PCG_NEO4J_HEAP_MAX_SIZE` | `512m` in compose | Docker Compose Neo4j container | Neo4j max heap size. | Raise with heap evidence; keep within host memory. |
| `PCG_NEO4J_PAGECACHE_SIZE` | `512m` in docs/examples | Docker Compose Neo4j container | Neo4j page cache budget. | Raise when graph read/write workloads are page-cache bound and host memory allows. |
| `PCG_POSTGRES_PORT` | `15432` in compose | Docker Compose | Host Postgres port. | Change to avoid local port conflicts or expose compose Postgres to host-side tests. |
| `PCG_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `change-me` in compose | Docker Compose/Postgres | Password used by compose Postgres and generated DSNs. | Change for non-local compose; update matching DSNs/secrets. |
| `PCG_PG_SHARED_BUFFERS` | `4GB` in compose | Postgres container | Postgres shared buffers. | Tune only with Postgres memory/IO evidence. |
| `PCG_PG_WORK_MEM` | `16MB` in compose | Postgres container | Per-operation work memory. | Raise carefully for sort/hash-heavy queries; multiplied by concurrency. |
| `PCG_PG_MAINTENANCE_WORK_MEM` | `512MB` in compose | Postgres container | Maintenance operation memory. | Raise for index/build maintenance if host memory allows. |
| `PCG_PG_MAX_WAL_SIZE` | `8GB` in compose | Postgres container | WAL size before checkpoint pressure. | Raise if checkpoint churn appears during large ingest. |
| `PCG_PG_WAL_BUFFERS` | `64MB` in compose | Postgres container | WAL buffer budget. | Tune only with Postgres WAL evidence. |
| `PCG_PG_EFFECTIVE_CACHE_SIZE` | `32GB` in compose | Postgres container | Planner estimate of OS cache. | Match host/container memory; not a direct allocation. |
| `PCG_PG_SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` | `off` in compose | Postgres container | Commit durability/latency trade-off for local compose. | Keep production durability policy explicit; compose uses speed-oriented local default. |
| `PCG_PG_TOAST_COMPRESSION` | `lz4` in compose | Postgres container | TOAST compression algorithm. | Change only for Postgres compatibility or storage experiments. |
| `OTEL_COLLECTOR_OTLP_GRPC_PORT` | `4317` in compose | Docker Compose | Host OTLP gRPC port. | Change to avoid local port conflicts. |
| `OTEL_COLLECTOR_OTLP_HTTP_PORT` | `4318` in compose | Docker Compose | Host OTLP HTTP port. | Change to avoid local port conflicts. |
| `OTEL_COLLECTOR_PROMETHEUS_PORT` | `9464` in compose | Docker Compose | Host Prometheus scrape/export port. | Change to avoid local port conflicts. |

## Terraform Schema

| Variable | Default | Read By | Purpose | Tune When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PCG_TERRAFORM_SCHEMA_DIR` | packaged/default schema dir | Terraform schema loader | Overrides Terraform provider schema directory. | Use for local schema development or testing newly generated provider schemas. |

## Test And Perf Gates

| Variable | Default | Read By | Purpose | Tune When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PCG_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_PERF` | unset / `false` | opt-in Go tests | Enables local-authoritative startup/query performance smoke tests. | Set only when `PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY` points at a real binary and the host is prepared for sidecar tests. |

## Deprecated Or Unsupported

These names may appear in older docs, scripts, or historical configs. They are
not supported tuning surfaces for the current Go runtime:

- `PCG_REPO_FILE_PARSE_MULTIPROCESS`
- `PCG_MULTIPROCESS_START_METHOD`
- `PCG_WORKER_MAX_TASKS`
- `PCG_INDEX_QUEUE_DEPTH`
- `PCG_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`
- `PCG_COMMIT_WORKERS`
- `PCG_MAX_CALLS_PER_FILE`

If one of these looks necessary, stop and identify which current Go stage owns
the behavior before adding a replacement knob.
