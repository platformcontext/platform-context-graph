# Graph Backend Installation

PCG's `local_authoritative` profile and its Compose / production profiles
read the canonical graph through a **graph backend adapter**. The default
adapter is NornicDB. Neo4j remains available as an explicit compatibility
backend. Adoption history lives in
[ADR 2026-04-22 — NornicDB As Candidate Graph Backend](../adrs/2026-04-22-nornicdb-graph-backend-candidate.md).

This page documents how to install a graph backend locally so the PCG
lightweight host can run the `local_authoritative` profile without Docker
Compose.

## Backend selection

Set the graph backend explicitly via environment variable:

- `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=nornicdb` — default
- `PCG_GRAPH_BACKEND=neo4j` — explicit Neo4j path

Invalid values are rejected at startup. There is no silent default.

The backend axis is also surfaced optionally in responses as `truth.backend`
and in telemetry span / metric labels as `graph_backend`.

## Profile requirements

| Profile | Graph backend required |
| --- | --- |
| `local_lightweight` | None |
| `local_authoritative` | Yes, installed locally via the steps below |
| `local_full_stack` | Provided by Compose; NornicDB by default, Neo4j via `docker-compose.neo4j.yml` |
| `production` | Provided by Helm / Kubernetes as an external Bolt-compatible graph endpoint |

## Current local-authoritative requirement

`local_authoritative` requires a verified NornicDB binary. PCG
defaults to the laptop-friendly headless artifact and discovers binaries in
this order:

1. `PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY`
2. `${PCG_HOME}/bin/nornicdb-headless` installed by
   `pcg install nornicdb --from <source>`
3. `nornicdb-headless` on `PATH`
4. `nornicdb` on `PATH`

The environment variable stays first so advanced users can temporarily test a
different binary without mutating the managed install.

The full `nornicdb` binary is supported when users opt in with
`PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY` or place it on `PATH`, but it is not the local-laptop
default because it can carry UI / local-LLM payloads and is materially
larger. PCG still starts the process with `nornicdb serve --headless` and
`NORNICDB_HEADLESS=true`; those runtime flags disable UI endpoints but do
not make the full binary smaller. Hosted evaluation and future production
packaging may use the full deployment artifact when that profile is
promoted.

PCG verifies candidate binaries by running `<binary> version` and requiring a
`NornicDB ...` version string. A random admin password is generated once per
workspace graph data root and stored in
`graph/nornicdb/pcg-credentials.json` with `0600` permissions. The live owner
copies it to `owner.json` so attach processes can connect without a hardcoded
shared secret.

## Managed install

PCG currently tracks the latest NornicDB `main` branch. For now, that means
the truthful local install path is explicit: build or choose the NornicDB
binary you want to evaluate, then install it with `--from`.

Bare `pcg install nornicdb` is intentionally unavailable while the embedded
release manifest has no accepted assets. It fails with guidance to build from
NornicDB `main` and install that binary explicitly. This keeps local
authoritative runs from silently using an older forked asset.

Explicit `--from` installs can consume any of these artefacts:

- a local NornicDB binary
- a local `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tgz` archive containing `nornicdb-headless`
  or `nornicdb`
- a local `.pkg` containing `/usr/local/bin/nornicdb` or `nornicdb-headless`
- an `http://`, `https://`, or `file://` URL to one of those artefacts

Remote URL downloads default to a `30s` client timeout and honor `Ctrl-C`.
Set `PCG_NORNICDB_INSTALL_TIMEOUT=<duration>` when slower links need a larger
budget. The value uses Go duration syntax such as `45s`, `2m`, or `2m30s`.

```bash
pcg install nornicdb --from /absolute/path/to/nornicdb-headless

# Local archive.
pcg install nornicdb \
  --from /absolute/path/to/nornicdb-headless-darwin-arm64.tar.gz \
  --sha256 <expected-archive-sha256>

# Local or remote macOS package.
pcg install nornicdb \
  --from /absolute/path/to/NornicDB-main-arm64-lite.pkg \
  --sha256 <expected-package-sha256>

# Remote artefact URL.
pcg install nornicdb \
  --from https://example.com/releases/nornicdb-headless-darwin-arm64.tar.gz \
  --sha256 <expected-archive-sha256>

# Replace an existing managed binary.
pcg install nornicdb --from /absolute/path/to/nornicdb-headless --force
```

The command performs, in order:

1. Resolves `--from` to a local path or downloads the remote artefact to a
   temporary file. Remote downloads honor `cmd.Context()` cancellation and use
   `PCG_NORNICDB_INSTALL_TIMEOUT` when set, otherwise `30s`.
2. If the source is a tar archive, extracts the first usable
   `nornicdb-headless` entry, or falls back to `nornicdb` when the archive
   only contains the full binary.
3. If the source is a macOS `.pkg`, expands the package and extracts the
   packaged `usr/local/bin/nornicdb` payload without installing the package
   system-wide.
4. Verifies the resulting binary by running `<binary> version` and requiring a
   `NornicDB ...` version string.
5. Computes the source artefact SHA-256 checksum and compares it with
   `--sha256` when provided.
6. Copies the verified binary to `${PCG_HOME}/bin/nornicdb-headless` with
   executable permissions.
7. Writes
   `${PCG_HOME}/graph-backends/nornicdb/manifest.json` with backend,
   version, installed-binary checksum, source checksum, source kind, source
   locator, install mode, and install timestamp.

After installation, `pcg graph status` should report `graph_installed: true`
and the managed binary path.

Because managed installs win over `PATH`, a previously installed binary can
shadow a freshly built `nornicdb-headless` on your shell path. Use one of these
paths when you want to evaluate a new NornicDB `main` build:

- reinstall it with `pcg install nornicdb --from <path> --force`
- set `PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=<path>` for a temporary override

## Manual source build options

A developer can build or provide the binary in one of these ways before
calling `pcg install nornicdb --from ...`:

```bash
# Preferred laptop path from a NornicDB checkout when plugin prerequisites
# are installed.
make build-headless
pcg install nornicdb --from /absolute/path/to/NornicDB/bin/nornicdb-headless

# Reliable local fallback when optional local-LLM/plugin prerequisites are
# absent on the laptop.
go build -tags 'noui nolocalllm' -o /tmp/nornicdb-headless ./cmd/nornicdb
pcg install nornicdb --from /tmp/nornicdb-headless

# Explicit opt-in to the larger full binary.
PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/absolute/path/to/nornicdb pcg graph status

# Runtime-only headless mode for a full binary. This disables UI endpoints
# but does not reduce binary size.
NORNICDB_HEADLESS=true nornicdb serve
nornicdb serve --headless
```

Container builds are useful for hosted or Compose-style experiments, but the
current laptop sidecar launches a local binary:

```bash
docker build --build-arg HEADLESS=true -f docker/Dockerfile.arm64-metal .
```

## No-argument install status

```bash
pcg install nornicdb
```

This command is reserved for future release-backed installs. Today it fails
because PCG tracks latest NornicDB `main` through explicit `--from` binaries
instead of shipping an embedded release asset. When no-argument installs come
back, they must be backed by an accepted manifest entry and checksum policy.

## Planned release-install hardening

Still planned:

- accepted release or build manifest entries
- remote or release-synchronized manifest updates when needed
- Sigstore / Cosign signature verification
- explicit unsigned-artifact policy
- broader host coverage once those assets are genuinely published

### Upgrade

```bash
pcg graph upgrade --from /absolute/path/to/nornicdb-headless
```

Replaces the installed binary from a verified local executable after the
workspace graph has been stopped. Release-backed semver upgrades remain future
work.

### Rollback

Rollback is not wired yet. For now, keep the prior NornicDB binary somewhere
local and reinstall it explicitly with:

```bash
pcg install nornicdb --from <path> --force
```

### Offline archive or package install

```bash
pcg install nornicdb --from <path-to-tarball-or-pkg>
```

This is now supported for tar archives and macOS packages, but signature verification for offline
artefacts remains future work.

### Uninstall

Uninstall is not wired yet. Remove the managed binary and install manifest
manually only when the workspace owner is stopped and you no longer need that
managed backend entry. Workspace graph data directories are separate from the
binary install and should be preserved unless you are intentionally discarding
local graph state.

## Supply chain

The checked-in release manifest currently has no accepted NornicDB assets.
Latest-main evaluation is explicit-source only.

Still planned before promotion:

- pinned graph-backend version per PCG release or an equivalent accepted-build
  policy
- artifact SHA-256 checksum
- upstream release URL
- signing policy (`required`, `preferred`, `disabled`)
- Sigstore / Cosign verification metadata
- externalized manifest publication / refresh strategy

The stricter operator override layer is not wired yet.

## Verification

After install, verify with:

```bash
pcg doctor
pcg graph status
```

Both should report the graph backend as present, the binary path, and the
installed version.

After managed install, verify with:

```bash
pcg graph status
```

When building directly from a local NornicDB checkout for laptop testing,
prefer the repository target when its optional plugin prerequisites are
available. If that target fails because local-LLM/plugin libraries are not
installed, use the direct no-UI/no-local-LLM fallback:

```bash
make build-headless
pcg install nornicdb --from /absolute/path/to/NornicDB/bin/nornicdb-headless
pcg graph status

go build -tags 'noui nolocalllm' -o /tmp/nornicdb-headless ./cmd/nornicdb
pcg install nornicdb --from /tmp/nornicdb-headless
pcg graph status
```

## Non-goals

- Installing Neo4j. Neo4j remains an explicit operator-managed compatibility
  path.
- Running the graph backend as a system service. The sidecar is a
  user-level process tied to the PCG lightweight host lifecycle.
- Bundling the graph backend into the `pcg` binary. See the rejection in
  [ADR 2026-04-20](../adrs/2026-04-20-embedded-local-backends-desktop-mode.md)
  and the sidecar exception in
  [ADR 2026-04-22](../adrs/2026-04-22-nornicdb-graph-backend-candidate.md).
