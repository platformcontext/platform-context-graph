# Capability Conformance Spec

This document defines the capability matrix that governs lightweight local,
full local stack, and production query behavior.

It exists for two reasons:

- to keep the product contract explicit
- to give Chunks 2 and 5 a machine-readable source for tests and backend
  conformance runs
- to keep truth labels aligned with the wire contract defined in
  `truth-label-protocol.md`

The canonical machine-readable source for this matrix lives at:

- `specs/capability-matrix.v1.yaml`

## Why This Exists

PCG cannot rely on prose like "local mode should be good at search" or
"production is authoritative."

The runtime needs one explicit matrix that says:

- which capability is being discussed
- which profile is being evaluated
- whether the capability is supported
- what truth level is allowed
- what latency envelope is expected
- what scope size the claim applies to
- which verification gate proves it

Without that matrix, backend experiments and local-mode work will drift into
undocumented differences.

## Capability IDs

Capability families are grouped by user intent, not storage backend. That keeps
the contract stable even if backend implementations change.

The initial capability families are:

- `code_search.exact_symbol`
- `code_search.fuzzy_symbol`
- `code_search.variable_lookup`
- `code_search.content_search`
- `symbol_graph.decorators`
- `symbol_graph.argument_names`
- `symbol_graph.class_methods`
- `symbol_graph.imports`
- `symbol_graph.inheritance`
- `code_quality.complexity`
- `call_graph.direct_callers`
- `call_graph.direct_callees`
- `call_graph.transitive_callers`
- `call_graph.transitive_callees`
- `call_graph.call_chain_path`
- `code_quality.dead_code`
- `platform_impact.deployment_chain`
- `platform_impact.context_overview`
- `platform_impact.resource_to_code`
- `platform_impact.dependency_path`
- `platform_impact.environment_compare`
- `platform_impact.change_surface`
- `platform_impact.blast_radius`

## MCP Tool To Capability Mapping

The same capability ID may back more than one surface or tool. Initial mapping:

| MCP tool | Primary capability IDs |
| --- | --- |
| `find_code` | `code_search.exact_symbol`, `code_search.fuzzy_symbol` |
| `search_file_content` | `code_search.content_search` |
| `analyze_code_relationships` | `call_graph.direct_callers`, `call_graph.direct_callees`, `call_graph.transitive_callers`, `call_graph.transitive_callees` |
| `find_function_call_chain` | `call_graph.call_chain_path` |
| `find_dead_code` | `code_quality.dead_code` |
| `calculate_cyclomatic_complexity` | `code_quality.complexity` |
| `find_most_complex_functions` | `code_quality.complexity` |
| `find_blast_radius` | `platform_impact.blast_radius` |
| `find_change_surface` | `platform_impact.change_surface` |
| `trace_deployment_chain` | `platform_impact.deployment_chain` |
| `find_infra_resources` | `platform_impact.deployment_chain` |
| `analyze_infra_relationships` | `platform_impact.deployment_chain` |
| `get_repo_context` | `platform_impact.context_overview` |
| `get_service_context` | `platform_impact.context_overview` |
| `get_ecosystem_overview` | `platform_impact.context_overview` |
| `execute_language_query` | `symbol_graph.decorators`, `symbol_graph.argument_names`, `symbol_graph.class_methods`, `symbol_graph.imports`, `symbol_graph.inheritance` |
| `trace_resource_to_code` | `platform_impact.resource_to_code` |
| `explain_dependency_path` | `platform_impact.dependency_path` |
| `compare_environments` | `platform_impact.environment_compare` |

If a tool maps to multiple capability IDs, the response should identify the
capability actually exercised.

Some existing content, context, and runtime/admin tools remain outside the
initial local-codeintelligence capability matrix. They continue to be governed
by their existing runtime and API contracts until they are promoted into this
matrix explicitly.

## Profiles

Supported profile IDs:

- `local_lightweight`
- `local_authoritative`
- `local_full_stack`
- `production`

`local_authoritative` runs the lightweight local host plus a local graph
backend sidecar (see `graph-backend-installation.md`). It unlocks the
high-authority capabilities that `local_lightweight` refuses, without
requiring Docker Compose.

## Runtime Execution Modes

`required_runtime` is a separate axis from `profile`.

Allowed values:

- `local_host`
- `local_host_plus_graph`
- `full_stack`
- `deployed_services`

## Graph Backends

`graph_backend` is a separate axis from both `profile` and `required_runtime`.
It records which graph-adapter implementation served a response. This axis is
surfaced in telemetry and, optionally, in `truth.backend` on responses.

Allowed values:

- `neo4j`
- `nornicdb`

Default today is `neo4j`. Evaluation and adoption criteria for `nornicdb`
live in `docs/docs/adrs/2026-04-22-nornicdb-graph-backend-candidate.md`.
`local_lightweight` does not bind a graph backend because it refuses
graph-backed capabilities.

## Allowed Status Values

- `supported`
- `unsupported`
- `experimental`

## Allowed Verification Types

- `go_test`
- `integration_test`
- `compose_e2e`
- `remote_validation`

## Allowed Truth Levels

- `exact`
- `derived`
- `fallback`
- `unsupported`

`unsupported` is used in the matrix even though runtime responses use a
structured error instead of a truth label. This allows the same machine-readable
matrix to drive both capability gating and test expectations.

## Allowed Scope Sizes

- `active_repo`
- `active_monofolder`
- `indexed_workspace`
- `multi_repo_platform`

## Matrix Contract

The canonical YAML uses one entry per capability, with per-profile behavior
nested under `profiles`.

Each capability entry must provide:

- `capability`
- `tools`
- `profiles`

`tools` are declared per capability, not per profile. That means one MCP tool
may expose the same capability across multiple profiles while still returning a
different truth level, latency envelope, or support status in each profile.

Each `profiles.<profile_id>` object must provide:

- `status`
- `max_truth_level`
- `required_runtime`
- `p95_latency_ms`
- `max_scope_size`
- `verification`
- `notes`

`p95_latency_ms: null` means "not applicable because the capability is
unsupported for that profile."

## Rules

1. If a row is `supported`, the runtime must not exceed `max_truth_level`.
2. If a row is `unsupported`, the runtime must return a structured
   unsupported-capability error rather than silently degrading.
3. `experimental` rows must never be described as production-ready in docs.
4. Backend conformance can only elevate a graph adapter after the matrix passes
   for the intended profile.
5. Matrix rows must stay aligned with the envelope semantics in
   `truth-label-protocol.md`.
6. `status: unsupported` maps to `error.code=unsupported_capability` in the
   wire contract.

## Test Responsibilities

### Chunk 2

Use the matrix to verify that extracted capability ports preserve the currently
allowed response behavior for each profile.

### Chunk 5

Use the matrix as the baseline conformance harness input for any backend under
evaluation.

## Change Policy

Changing the matrix is a product contract change. Every matrix edit must
include:

- the updated machine-readable YAML
- matching docs if user-visible behavior changed
- a verification update for the affected profile/capability pair

Capability lifecycle rules:

- add
  - introduce a new ID and add matrix rows for every supported profile
- deprecate
  - keep the ID in the matrix with a deprecation note for at least one release
- remove
  - only after the deprecation window and client-facing docs have been updated
