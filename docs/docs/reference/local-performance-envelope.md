# Local Performance Envelope

This document defines the target envelope for the lightweight local host.

## Goals

The local host should be useful on a normal developer laptop, not only on ideal
hardware or empty repos.

## Initial Targets

Reference hardware:

- Apple Silicon laptop with 16 GB RAM
- or mid-range x86 laptop with 4+ cores and 16 GB RAM

Targets are split by profile because the `local_authoritative` profile runs a
graph backend sidecar and therefore carries more cold-start cost.

### `local_lightweight` profile (PCG + embedded Postgres only)

- cold start: under 5 seconds
- warm restart: under 2 seconds
- exact symbol lookup p95: under 500 ms
- content search p95: under 800 ms
- complexity query p95: under 1500 ms
- single-file reindex to visible search update: under 2 seconds
- initial index of an active repo: document and measure against the capability
  matrix scope sizes
- idle memory budget: document and measure
- active indexing memory budget: document and measure

### `local_authoritative` profile (PCG + embedded Postgres + graph backend sidecar)

- cold start: under 15 seconds (Postgres warmup plus graph-backend warmup)
- warm restart: under 5 seconds (same workspace data root, graph backend
  data directory reused)
- transitive caller p95: under 2 seconds on an active repo
- call-chain path p95: under 2 seconds on an active repo
- dead-code scan for an active repo: under 10 seconds
- reducer bulk write batch: under 10 seconds for 50K facts
- idle memory budget: document and measure (PCG host + graph backend idle)
- active indexing memory budget: document and measure (PCG host + graph
  backend under load)
- single-file reindex to visible transitive-caller update: under 5 seconds

## Workload Shapes

Targets should be tracked at least for:

- active repo
- active monofolder

The capability matrix should tie latency expectations to these scope sizes.

Warm restart means the same workspace data root is reused and no full reindex is
required. Cold start means starting the host from a stopped state with no warm
processes already attached.

## Backpressure Expectations

- fsnotify events must be coalesced and debounced
- parse and projection pools must be bounded
- the runtime must prefer bounded lag over unbounded CPU or memory growth

## Current Startup Evidence

The `local_authoritative` startup envelope now has a dedicated manual gate:

```bash
PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/pcg-bare-install-smoke/bin/nornicdb-headless \
PCG_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_PERF=true \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestLocalAuthoritativeStartupEnvelope -count=1 -v
```

That gate boots the real local host, embedded Postgres, schema bootstrap, and
managed NornicDB sidecar, then measures readiness at the owner-record and
ingester handoff. It runs twice against the same workspace data root so the
first pass captures cold start and the second pass captures warm restart.

Recorded sample on 2026-04-23:

- cold start: `9.045253708s`
- warm restart: `490.996625ms`

These measurements pass the current `local_authoritative` startup targets.
Broader dead-code, reducer-throughput, and memory-budget targets remain open
until their own perf gates land.

## Current Query-Latency Evidence

The `local_authoritative` call-chain path now has a dedicated manual smoke:

```bash
PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/pcg-bare-install-smoke/bin/nornicdb-headless \
PCG_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_PERF=true \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestLocalAuthoritativeCallChainSyntheticEnvelope -count=1 -v
```

That gate boots the real local host, embedded Postgres, and managed NornicDB
sidecar, seeds a synthetic four-function `CALLS` chain through the shared Bolt
driver path, and exercises the real `/api/v0/code/call-chain` handler in
`local_authoritative`.

Recorded sample on 2026-04-23:

- synthetic call-chain p95: `736.25µs`

This smoke confirms that the backend-routed NornicDB call-chain path is
functionally live and comfortably below the current `under 2 seconds` target
for a synthetic path workload. It is not a substitute for active-repo
transitive-caller, active-repo call-chain, dead-code, or memory-budget proof.

The `local_authoritative` transitive-caller path now also has a dedicated
manual smoke:

```bash
PCG_NORNICDB_BINARY=/tmp/pcg-bare-install-smoke/bin/nornicdb-headless \
PCG_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_PERF=true \
  go test ./cmd/pcg -run TestLocalAuthoritativeTransitiveCallersSyntheticEnvelope -count=1 -v
```

That gate boots the real local host, embedded Postgres, and managed NornicDB
sidecar, seeds the same synthetic four-function `CALLS` chain through the
shared Bolt driver path, and exercises the real
`/api/v0/code/relationships` transitive-callers handler in
`local_authoritative`.

Recorded sample on 2026-04-23:

- synthetic transitive-caller p95: `1.917916ms`

This smoke confirms that the backend-routed NornicDB transitive-callers path
is functionally live and comfortably below the current `under 2 seconds`
target for a synthetic traversal workload. It is still not a substitute for
active-repo transitive-caller, dead-code, or memory-budget proof.

## Review Rule

If the local host misses these targets, the docs and matrix should reflect the
actual supported envelope instead of hiding the miss.
