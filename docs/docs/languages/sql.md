## Support Maturity
- Grammar routing: `supported`
- Normalization: `supported`
- Framework pack status: `unsupported`
- Framework packs: -
- Query surfacing: `supported`
- Real-repo validation: `supported (bounded)`
- End-to-end indexing: `supported (bounded)`
- Notes:
  - SQL support runs end to end through the current parser, migration extraction, embedded SQL link hints, and the JSON-backed dbt and data-intelligence families.
- The remaining dbt lineage limits
  (unresolved references, truly opaque templated expressions, complex macros,
  and some derived expressions) are bounded non-goals for the documented SQL
  surface. Real-repo and end-to-end validation is bounded by those same
  limits.
- Row-level aggregate lineage, simple windowed expressions, and simple
  qualified macro wrappers such as `dbt_utils.identity(source.amount)` are now
  tracked in the Go dbt path.
- Nested safe wrappers over those supported row-level forms, such as
  `upper(coalesce(source.segment, 'unknown'))`, are also tracked in the Go dbt
  path.
- The checked-in dbt parity matrix now explicitly proves cast, `date_trunc`,
  `concat`, `concat_ws`, `md5`, multi-source `case`, multi-source arithmetic,
  safe scalar wrappers over lineage-preserving qualified macros, top-level
  Jinja wrappers around supported lineage-safe expressions, and the key
  unresolved-summary paths in
  `go/internal/parser/dbt_sql_lineage_parity_test.go`.
- The Go query/content path now also has checked-in proof that dbt-derived
  `AnalyticsModel` and `DataAsset` content entities survive materialization and
  show semantic summaries through the normal entity resolve/context fallback
  surfaces.
- The fixture-backed dbt manifest proof now also covers wildcard expansion plus
  `coalesce(...)` lineage preservation for `orders_expanded.customer_segment` in
  `go/internal/parser/json_dbt_test.go`.
- The checked-in SQL procedural proof now covers `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`
  bodies, tagged dollar-quoted routine bodies with `LANGUAGE` before or after
  `AS`, `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`, `CREATE PROCEDURE`, legacy `EXECUTE
  PROCEDURE` trigger wiring, `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS`, `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS`, and fixture-backed
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...` column materialization, including bounded
  multi-clause `ADD COLUMN` normalization, in
  `go/internal/parser/engine_sql_test.go`,
  `go/internal/parser/sql_core_parity_test.go`, and
  `go/internal/parser/sql_parity_test.go`.
- The current content and query fallback path now also has checked-in SQL-core
  proof in `go/internal/content/shape/materialize_sql_test.go` and
  `go/internal/query/entity_content_sql_core_fallback_test.go`.
- Compiled-model lineage still carries explicit unresolved limits for
  unresolved references, truly opaque templated expressions, complex macros,
  and some derived expressions.
- Templated wrappers around opaque macro bodies stay unresolved on purpose;
  they are reported as `templated_expression_not_resolved` instead of being
  guessed into lineage.

## Data-Intelligence Path

The SQL and analytics runtime is implemented end to end in the current platform.

- Native SQL parsing and schema-object extraction live in `go/internal/parser/sql_language.go`
- Migration intelligence lives in `go/internal/parser/sql_migrations.go`
- Embedded SQL extraction for Go code lives in `go/internal/parser/go_embedded_sql.go`
- dbt compiled-SQL lineage lives in `go/internal/parser/dbt_sql_lineage.go`
- dbt manifest shaping lives in `go/internal/parser/json_dbt_manifest.go`
- JSON data-intelligence families live in `go/internal/parser/json_data_intelligence.go`
- dbt content-entity materialization proof lives in
  `go/internal/content/shape/materialize_analytics_test.go`
- dbt entity resolve/context proof lives in
  `go/internal/query/entity_content_sql_fallback_test.go`


## Known Limitations
- Dialect-specific procedural SQL beyond the common Postgres-style
  dollar-quoted function and procedure bodies proven above remains a bounded
  non-goal.
- Broader ALTER/DDL mutation normalization beyond checked-in `ADD COLUMN`
  materialization, bounded multi-clause `ADD COLUMN` normalization, and the
  core table/index variants proven above remains a bounded non-goal.
- Compiled dbt lineage still records partial coverage for unresolved references,
  templated expressions, complex macro expansion, and some derived
  expressions.
- Templated wrappers around opaque macro bodies remain an intentional non-goal
  and are surfaced as `templated_expression_not_resolved`. Non-templated
  opaque wrappers are not treated as one clean resolved category.
